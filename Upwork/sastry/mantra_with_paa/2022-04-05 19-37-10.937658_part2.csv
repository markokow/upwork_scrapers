<p>Kismis, or raisins, are well-known and well-loved as nature’s candy. One of the greatest kismis benefits is that it is a natural source of sugar without any additives. Hence, they can give your bodies a much-needed energy boost as and when required. Of course, this fact stands true when you are consuming organic food items. Organic products are untainted by chemicals or toxins that make them healthier than other food items.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the <strong>benefits of raisins soaked in water</strong>, then you are in luck! In this post, we will explore the <strong>benefits of raisins soaked in water</strong> along with other <strong>kismis benefits</strong> associated with the dry fruit.</p>
<h3>How to Have Raisins Soaked in Water?</h3>
<p>Rinse 15-30 raisins in running water and add them to a cup of drinking water. Let them soak overnight and eat them the next morning on an empty stomach.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Have Raisins Soaked in Water?</h3>
<p>Raisins offer several health benefits (more on that later). However, it can be tough to extract all its nutritional benefits in one go. Hence, when you soak them in water, you enhance the bioavailability of the nutrients.</p>
<figure class=""image""><img class="""" height=""376"" src=""https://wp-public-fs.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/tasks/15f6364b064d933b55836a0d8bdb80cd53a1d36626b809/images/raisin_5d36c417e295b-5f6d8b02a823d.jpg"" width=""593""/><figcaption><a href=""https://media.newstracklive.com/uploads/health-lifestyle/health-tips/Jul/23/big_thumb/raisin_5d36c417e295b.JPG"">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, the benefits of raisins soaked in water surpass the benefits of having them raw. The vitamins and minerals present in the outer skin and layer of the kishmish dissolve in water. So the nutrients that would have otherwise passed through your body directly now get ingested through the raisin water. Additionally, soaking raisins in water also boosts its antioxidant content.</p>
<h3>Health and Dietary <mark class=""marker-yellow"">Benefits of Raisins Soaked in Water</mark></h3>
<p>Now that you understand the overall benefits of raisins soaked in water, here are some other general health and dietary benefits offered by raisins:</p>
<h4>Detoxifies the Body</h4>
<p>Apart from soaking raisins in water, one can also make raisin detox water by soaking 150 grams of raisins in two cups of water. The following morning, you can strain out the water and drink it on an empty stomach. This routine flushes out all the harmful toxins from the body and improves the biochemical processes of the liver. It will also cleanse your blood.</p>
<p>However, do this only with organic raisins as non-organic kishmish may introduce chemicals into the detoxifying drink.</p>
<h4>Regulates Blood Pressure</h4>
<p>Raisins are a rich source of potassium. Potassium can counter the effects of sodium, which otherwise increases the blood pressure. Hence, the balance of salts helps in maintaining the blood pressure in a healthy range.</p>
<h4>Supports Digestive Health</h4>
<p><strong>Kismis benefits</strong> the digestive system by supplying a good amount of dietary fibres. Upon soaking them, the soluble fibres already form the gel-like substance that will slow down the digestive processes. They also have a mild laxative effect, which will help relieve constipation.</p>
<h4>Strengthens Immune System</h4>
<p>Raisins are rich in vitamins B and C and are also loaded with antioxidants. As a result, they can strengthen your body’s natural immune response. The bioflavonoids present in kismis also protect the body from infections</p>
<h4>Promotes Bone and Teeth Health</h4>
<figure class=""image""><img class="""" height=""443"" src=""https://wp-public-fs.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/tasks/15f6364b064d933b55836a0d8bdb80cd53a1d36626b809/images/health-benefits-of-drinki-5f6d8b292b8a7.jpg"" width=""591""/><figcaption><a href=""https://images.lifealth.com/uploads/2018/07/Health-Benefits-of-Drinking-Raisins-1.jpg"">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>About 100 grams of raisins contain 50 mg of calcium along with other trace minerals, such as phosphorus and boron. As a result, the regular consumption of raisins can enhance the absorption of these nutrients and strengthen teeth and bones while also improving the bone mineral density.</p>
<h4>Prevents Anaemia</h4>
<p>Iron is essential for the formation of red blood cells (RBCs) in our body. As raisins are rich in iron, they can boost the production of RBCs, thereby preventing anaemia. Additionally, raisins soaked in water act as a good source of nitric oxide, which boosts the flow of blood through the body.</p>
<h4>Protects the Heart</h4>
<p>Since raisins monitor blood pressure and purify the blood, they are already excellent food for the cardiovascular system. The high fibre content and mineral composition of raisins help in bringing down the blood cholesterol. Furthermore, it eases the load on the heart, which cuts down the risk of stroke, heart failure, hypertension, and other such diseases.</p>
<h4>Boosts Performance</h4>
<p>Raisins are mainly carbohydrates. The simple sugars are easy to break down and give the body an instant energy boost. The protein content, along with other amino acids help in the recovery of the body after extensive workouts. As a result, having raisins soaked in water can improve your athletic performance.</p>
<h4>Improves Sleep Quality</h4>
<p>One of the lesser-known raisin health benefits is its ability to aid sleep and improve sleep quality. Melatonin, a compound naturally present in raisins, helps you fall asleep quickly and soundly. Resultantly, you will enjoy a better night’s rest without waking up intermittently. The antioxidants present in raisins also neutralise the oxidative stress found in patients struggling with insomnia.</p>
<p>To enjoy the kismis benefits of improved sleep, you can also soak the raisins in milk, as milk too contains melatonin.</p>
