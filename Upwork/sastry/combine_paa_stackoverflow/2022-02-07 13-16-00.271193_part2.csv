https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18286432/vb-net-opening-and-closing-forms,winforms - VB.net opening and closing forms,"<blockquote>
<p>But everytime i switch forms the form load event will only trigger once. Is there something wrong with my code? I am guesing the Me.Hide() will only hide the previous form and not totally close it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what is happening. The <code>Hide</code> method just <em>hides</em> the form from the user, effectively making it invisible.</p>
<p>What youre looking for is the <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.close.aspx rel=noreferrer><code>Close</code> method</a>, which actually closes the form. (Since you are displaying the form using the <code>Show</code> method, you do not need to call <code>Dispose</code>.)</p>
<p>You will, however, not be able to close a form and continue to run code in its methods. So youll need to reverse the order of the statements in your event handler functions, displaying the other form <em>first</em> and then closing itself. Make them look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    Form1.Show()
    Me.Close()    
End Sub

Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    Form2.Show()
    Me.Close()
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>That will do what you want. The <code>Load</code> event will be triggered each time you call the <code>Show</code> method, because youre creating and showing a new form.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out, though, that youre relying on an unusual characteristic of VB.NET, one that it retains from the older VB languages for backwards compatibility reasons. Instead of referring to an <em>object</em> of your form class (like you would have to do with all other class objects), you are referring to it by the <em>type</em> name (the name of the class itself). You really shouldnt do that, it causes all sorts of headaches and will confuse people reading your code. It is better to just instantiate a new form object, like this:</p>
<pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    Dim frm As New Form1   create a new Form1 object
    frm.Show()             ... and display it

    Me.Close()
End Sub

Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    Dim frm As New Form1   create a new Form2 object
    frm.Show()             ... and display it

    Me.Close()
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>When you run this code, you will likely run immediately into another problem: the first time you close <code>Form1</code>, your entire application will quit. This is because, by default for a new project, <code>Form1</code> is designated as the Startup form in your projects properties (My Project in the Solution Explorer). You will either have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a <em>third</em> form to use as the main form, and set the Startup form to this third form, or</li>
<li>change the Shutdown mode (also in My Project) from When startup form closes to When last form closes.</li>
</ul>","<blockquote>
<p>I am guesing the Me.Hide() will only hide the previous form and not totally close it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does what it says.  If you want to close the form then use Me.Close() instead.  The Load event will fire again when you create the new instance.</p>
<p>Youll have to change a setting to ensure that doesnt also close your application.  Project + Properties, Application tab, change the Shutdown mode setting to When last form closes.  And put the Me.Close() call <em>after</em> the Show() call.</p>","<p>I also had a similar question. When u <code>.Hide()</code> you are just storing it away in memory somewhere such that when it is re-opened it doesnt have to make a new form just recalls the one from memory hence that method is not called again. You have to destroy the form. So what you can do when navigating to another form is go to that form first and then destroy the current form like so <br/> <code>Form2.Show()</code><br/><code>Me.Close()</code>. Look at my question and my accepted answer. If that works please dont forget to tick this as your accepted answer. <br/>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32232978/change-the-location-of-the-directory-in-a-windows-install-of-git-bash,msysgit - Change the location of the ~ directory in a Windows install of Git Bash,"<p>I dont understand, why you dont want to set the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable since that solves exactly what youre asking for.</p>
<p><code>cd ~</code> doesnt mean <em>change to the root directory</em>, but <strong>change to the users home directory</strong>, which is set by the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable.</p>
<h2>Quickndirty solution</h2>
<p>Edit <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\etc\profile</code> and set <code>$HOME</code> variable to whatever you want (add it if its not there). A good place could be for example right after a condition commented by <code># Set up USERs home directory</code>. It must be in the MinGW format, for example:</p>
<pre><code>HOME=/c/my/custom/home
</code></pre>
<p>Save it, open Git Bash and execute <code>cd ~</code>. You should be in a directory <code>/c/my/custom/home</code> now.</p>
<p>Everything that accesses the users profile should go into this directory instead of your Windows profile on a network drive.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\etc\profile</code> is shared by all users, so if the machine is used by multiple users, its a good idea to set the <code>$HOME</code> dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>HOME=/c/Users/$USERNAME
</code></pre>
<h2>Cleaner solution</h2>
<p>Set the environment variable <code>HOME</code> in Windows to whatever directory you want. In this case, you have to set it in Windows path format (with backslashes, e.g. <code>c:\my\custom\home</code>), Git Bash will load it and convert it to its format.</p>
<p>If you want to <strong>change the home directory for all users on your machine</strong>, set it as a <em>system environment variable</em>, where you can use for example <code>%USERNAME%</code> variable so every user will have his own home directory, for example:</p>
<pre><code>HOME=c:\custom\home\%USERNAME%
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to <strong>change the home directory just for yourself</strong>, set it as a <em>user environment variable</em>, so other users wont be affected. In this case, you can simply hard-code the whole path:</p>
<pre><code>HOME=c:\my\custom\home
</code></pre>","<p>In my case, all I had to do was add the following <em>User variable</em> on Windows:</p>
<p>Variable name: <code>HOME</code><br/>
Variable value: <code>%USERPROFILE%</code></p>

<p>The <code>HOME</code> environment variable is not normally set for Windows applications, so creating it through Windows did not affect anything else.  From the Computer Properties (right-click on Computer - or whatever it is named - in Explorer, and select Properties, or Control Panel -&gt; System and Security -&gt; System), choose <code>Advanced system settings</code>, then <code>Environment Variables...</code> and create a new one, <code>HOME</code>, and assign it wherever you like.</p>
