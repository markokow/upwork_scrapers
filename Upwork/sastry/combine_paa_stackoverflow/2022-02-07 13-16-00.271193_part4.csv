https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2755945/how-can-i-use-as-the-delimiter-with-string-split-in-java,How can I use . as the delimiter with String.split() in java,"<p><a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split%28java.lang.String%29 rel=noreferrer><code>String.split</code></a> takes a regex, and . has a special meaning for regexes.</p>
<p>You (probably) want something like:</p>
<pre><code>String[] words = line.split(\\.);
</code></pre>
<p>Some folks seem to be having trouble getting this to work, so here is some runnable code you can use to verify correct behaviour.</p>
<pre><code>import java.util.Arrays;

public class TestSplit {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String line = aa.bb.cc.dd;
    String[] words = line.split(\\.);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
    // Output is [aa, bb, cc, dd]
  }
}
</code></pre>","<p>When splitting with a string literal delimiter, the safest way is to use the <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#quote%28java.lang.String%29 rel=noreferrer>Pattern.quote()</a> method:</p>
<pre><code>String[] words = line.split(Pattern.quote(.));
</code></pre>
<p>As described by other answers, splitting with <code>\\.</code> is correct, but <code>quote()</code> will do this escaping for you.</p>","<p>The argument to split is a regular expression. The period is a regular expression metacharacter that matches anything, thus every character in <code>line</code> is considered to be a split character, and is thrown away, and all of the empty strings between them are thrown away (because theyre empty strings). The result is that you have nothing left.</p>
<p>If you escape the period (by adding an escaped backslash before it), then you can match literal periods.
