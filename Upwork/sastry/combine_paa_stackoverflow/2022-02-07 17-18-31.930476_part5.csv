https://stackoverflow.com/questions/141284/the-difference-between-the-runnable-and-callable-interfaces-in-java,multithreading - The difference between the Runnable and Callable interfaces in Java,"<p>See explanation <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html rel=noreferrer>here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Callable interface is similar to
  Runnable, in that both are designed
  for classes whose instances are
  potentially executed by another
  thread. <strong>A Runnable, however, does not
  return a result and cannot throw a
  checked exception.</strong></p>
</blockquote>","<blockquote>
<p>What are the differences in the applications of <code>Runnable</code> and <code>Callable</code>. Is the difference only with the return parameter present in <code>Callable</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, yes.  See the answers to <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/141284/the-difference-between-the-runnable-and-callable-interfaces-in-java>this question</a>.  And the <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html rel=noreferrer>javadoc for <code>Callable</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the need of having both if <code>Callable</code> can do all that <code>Runnable</code> does?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the <code>Runnable</code> interface <strong>cannot</strong> do everything that <code>Callable</code> does!</p>
<p><code>Runnable</code> has been around since Java 1.0, but <code>Callable</code> was only introduced in Java 1.5 ... to handle use-cases that <code>Runnable</code> does not support.  In theory, the Java team could have changed the signature of the <code>Runnable.run()</code> method, but this would have broken binary compatiblity with pre-1.5 code, requiring recoding when migrating old Java code to newer JVMs.  That is a BIG NO-NO.  Java strives to be backwards compatible ... and thats been one of Javas biggest selling points for business computing.</p>
<p>And, obviously, there are use-cases where a task doesnt <em>need</em> to return a result or throw a checked exception.  For those use-cases, using <code>Runnable</code> is more concise than using <code>Callable&lt;Void&gt;</code> and returning a dummy (<code>null</code>) value from the <code>call()</code> method.</p>","<ul>

<p>According to my understanding <code>cmpl</code> compares unsigned.</p>

<p>It does both, in a way.</p>
<p>The difference in signed vs. unsigned is here the usage of the jump instructions.</p>
<p>For <code>&gt;</code>, there is <code>ja</code> for unsigned and <code>jg</code> for signed (jump if above and jump if greater).</p>
<p>For <code>&lt;</code>, there is <code>jb</code> for unsigned and <code>jl</code> for signed (jump if below and jump if less).</p>
<p>To be exact, here is the meaning of several jump commands:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compares the first source operand with the second source operand and sets the 
  status flags in the EFLAGS register according to the results. The comparison is 
  performed by subtracting the second operand from the first operand and then setting 
  the status flags in the same manner as the SUB instruction. When an immediate

<p>The program will not work properly because at Line 1, when the user presses Enter, it will leave in the input buffer 2 character: Enter key (ASCII code 13) and \n (ASCII code 10).  Therefore, at Line 2, it will read the \n and will not wait for the user to enter a character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The behavior you see at line 2 is correct, but thats not quite the correct explanation.  With text-mode streams, it doesnt matter what line-endings your platform uses (whether carriage return (0x0D) + linefeed (0x0A), a bare CR, or a bare LF).  The C runtime library will take care of that for you: your program will see just <code>\n</code> for newlines.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2785612/c-what-does-the-colon-after-a-constructor-mean,"C++, What does the colon after a constructor mean?","<p>As others have said, its an initialisation list. You can use it for two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calling base class constructors</li>
<li>Initialising member variables before the body of the constructor executes.</li>
</ol>
<p>For case #1, I assume you understand inheritance (if thats not the case, let me know in the comments). So you are simply calling the constructor of your base class.</p>
<p>For case #2, the question may be asked: Why not just initialise it in the body of the constructor? The importance of the initialisation lists is particularly evident for <code>const</code> members. For instance, take a look at this situation, where I want to initialise <code>m_val</code> based on the constructor parameter:</p>
<pre><code>class Demo
{
    Demo(int&amp; val) 
     {
         m_val = val;
     }
private:
    const int&amp; m_val;
};
</code></pre>
<p>By the C++ specification, this is illegal. We cannot change the value of a <code>const</code> variable in the constructor, because it is marked as const. So you can use the initialisation list:</p>
<pre><code>class Demo
{
    Demo(int&amp; val) : m_val(val)
     {
     }
private:
    const int&amp; m_val;
};
</code></pre>
<p>That is the only time that you can change a const member variable. And as Michael noted in the comments section, it is also the only way to initialise a reference that is a class member.</p>
<p>Outside of using it to initialise <code>const</code> member variables, it seems to have been generally accepted as the way of initialising variables, so its clear to other programmers reading your code.</p>",<p>This is called an initialization list.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45615591/how-does-only-at-before-action-work-in-rails,How does `only:` at `before_action` work in Rails?,"<p>The <code>only</code> option of <code>before_action</code> defines one action OR a list of actions when the method/block will be executed first.</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<pre><code># defined actions: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
before_action :set_newsletter_email, only: [:show, :edit]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>set_newsletter_email</code> method will be called just before the <code>show</code> and <code>edit</code> actions.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The opposite option <code>except</code> define when NOT to execute the method/block.</p>
<pre><code># defined actions: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
before_action :set_newsletter_email, except: [:show, :edit]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>set_newsletter_email</code> method will be called for all existing actions EXCEPT <code>show</code> and <code>edit</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><code>only</code> / <code>except</code> is just a kind of whitelist/blacklist.</p>","<p>Option <code>:only</code> runs a method, :set_newsletter_email in this example, when any of the action defined in the list in square brackets <code>[:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]</code> is called in the current controller and runs before the actions is run. Any other action defined in the controller will not execute <code>:set_newsletter_email</code> method.</p>
<p>You can also do the opposite with <code>:except</code> option to define method that will run on every actions defined in the controller except the ones that are listed.</p>
<p>You can also do <code>after_action</code> that will run after the action in the controller</p>
<p>You can read about the filters and all the options here:
<a href=http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters rel=nofollow noreferrer>http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters</a></p>","<p>When a user navigates only to those routes, it will trigger the <code>:set_newsletter_email</code> function, usually at the end of that controller file.</p>
<p>So when the user navigates to the index method, it will not trigger it because <code>:set_newsletter_email</code> is <strong>only</strong> called for the methods on brackets.</p>
<p>In this case that callback is needed because it sets the resource in the single resource views before it is rendered.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>/newsletter/2</code> route will trigger the <code>:set_newsletter_email</code> that will first get the id from the link params and then it will look for the resource and set an instance variable with it.</p>
<p>I dont know what is your concern about security in this case, but this callback only gets the id param to set the resource and because youre using scaffolds it also generates a params function (also at the end of the file) that whitelists the parameters you defined earlier while generating the scaffold.</p>

<li>Copy the address of the folder (it probably will be

<li>Change the \ to / as \ is used for escape characters, to access the folder locations.</li>
