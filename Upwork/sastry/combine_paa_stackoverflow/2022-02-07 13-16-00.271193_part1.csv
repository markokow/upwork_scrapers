https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13214029/go-build-cannot-find-package-even-though-gopath-is-set,Go build: Cannot find package (even though GOPATH is set),"<p>It does not work because your <code>foobar.go</code> source file is not in a directory called <code>foobar</code>. <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code> try to match directories, not source files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <code>$GOPATH</code> to a valid directory, e.g. <code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go</code></li>
<li>Move <code>foobar.go</code> to <code>$GOPATH/src/foobar/foobar.go</code> and building should work just fine.</li>

<li><code>go install test</code> should now create an executable in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> that can be called by typing <code>test</code> into your terminal.</li>
</ol>","<p>Although the accepted answer is still correct about needing to match directories with package names, you really need to migrate to using Go modules instead of using GOPATH. New users who encounter this problem may be confused about the mentions of using GOPATH (as was I), which are now outdated. So, I will try to clear up this issue and provide guidance associated with preventing this issue when using Go modules.</p>
<p>If youre already familiar with Go modules and are experiencing this issue, skip down to my more specific sections below that cover some of the Go conventions that are easy to overlook or forget.</p>
<p>This guide teaches about Go modules: <a href=https://golang.org/doc/code.html rel=noreferrer>https://golang.org/doc/code.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Project organization with Go modules</strong></p>
<p>Once you migrate to Go modules, as mentioned in that article, organize the project code as described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A repository contains one or more modules. A module is a collection of
related Go packages that are released together. A Go repository
typically contains only one module, located at the root of the
repository. A file named go.mod there declares the module path: the
import path prefix for all packages within the module. The module
contains the packages in the directory containing its go.mod file as
well as subdirectories of that directory, up to the next subdirectory
containing another go.mod file (if any).</p>
<p>Each modules path not only serves as an import path prefix for its
packages, but also indicates where the go command should look to
download it. For example, in order to download the module
golang.org/x/tools, the go command would consult the repository
indicated by <a href=https://golang.org/x/tools rel=noreferrer>https://golang.org/x/tools</a> (described more here).</p>
<p>An import path is a string used to import a package. A packages
import path is its module path joined with its subdirectory within the
module. For example, the module github.com/google/go-cmp contains a
package in the directory cmp/. That packages import path is
github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp. Packages in the standard library do not
have a module path prefix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can initialize your module like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ go mod init github.com/mitchell/foo-app
</code></pre>
<p>Your code doesnt need to be located on github.com for it to build. However, its a best practice to structure your modules as if they will eventually be published.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding what happens when trying to get a package</strong></p>
<p>Theres a great article here that talks about what happens when you try to get a package or module: <a href=https://medium.com/rungo/anatomy-of-modules-in-go-c8274d215c16 rel=noreferrer>https://medium.com/rungo/anatomy-of-modules-in-go-c8274d215c16</a>
It discusses where the package is stored and will help you understand why you might be getting this error if youre already using Go modules.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure the imported function has been exported</strong></p>
<p>Note that if youre having trouble accessing a function from another file, you need to ensure that youve exported your function. As described in the first link I provided, a function must begin with an upper-case letter to be exported and made available for importing into other packages.</p>
<p><strong>Names of directories</strong></p>
<p>Another critical detail (as was mentioned in the accepted answer) is that names of directories are what define the names of your packages. (Your package names need to match their directory names.) You can see examples of this here: <a href=https://medium.com/rungo/everything-you-need-to-know-about-packages-in-go-b8bac62b74cc rel=noreferrer>https://medium.com/rungo/everything-you-need-to-know-about-packages-in-go-b8bac62b74cc</a>
With that said, the file containing your <code>main</code> method (i.e., the entry point of your application) is sort of exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>As an example, I had problems with my imports when using a structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>/my-app
├── go.mod
├── /src
   ├── main.go
   └── /utils
      └── utils.go
</code></pre>
<p>I was unable to import the code in <code>utils</code> into my <code>main</code> package.</p>
<p>However, once I put <code>main.go</code> into its own subdirectory, as shown below, my imports worked just fine:</p>
<pre><code>/my-app
├── go.mod
├── /src
   ├── /app
   |  └── main.go
   └── /utils
      └── utils.go
</code></pre>
<p>In that example, my go.mod file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>module git.mydomain.com/path/to/repo/my-app

go 1.14
</code></pre>
<p>When I saved main.go after adding a reference to <code>utils.MyFunction()</code>, my IDE automatically pulled in the reference to my package like this:</p>
<pre><code>import git.mydomain.com/path/to/repo/my-app/src/my-app
</code></pre>
<p>(Im using VS Code with the Golang extension.)</p>
<p>Notice that the import path included the subdirectory to the package.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with a private repo</strong></p>
<p>If the code is part of a private repo, you need to run a git command to enable access. Otherwise, you can encounter other errors This article mentions how to do that for private Github, BitBucket, and GitLab repos: <a href=https://medium.com/cloud-native-the-gathering/go-modules-with-private-git-repositories-dfe795068db4 rel=noreferrer>https://medium.com/cloud-native-the-gathering/go-modules-with-private-git-repositories-dfe795068db4</a>

<pre><code>go env -w  GO111MODULE=off

<p>Reference: <a href=https://maelvls.dev/go111module-everywhere/ rel=nofollow noreferrer>Why is GO111MODULE everywhere, and everything about Go Modules (updated with Go 1.17)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GO111MODULE with Go 1.16</strong></p>
<p>As of Go 1.16, the default behavior is GO111MODULE=on, meaning that if
you want to keep using the old GOPATH way, you will have to force Go
not to use the Go Modules feature:</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19627795/why-hadoop-is-not-a-real-time-platform,why Hadoop is not a real-time platform,"<p>Hadoop was initially designed for batch processing. That means, take a large dataset in input all at once, process it, and write a large output. The very concept of MapReduce is geared towards batch and not real-time. But to be honest, this was only the case at Hadoops beginning, and now you have plenty of opportunities to use Hadoop in a more real-time way.</p>
<p>First I think its important to define what you mean by real-time. It could be that youre interested in stream processing, or could also be that you want to run queries on your data that return results in real-time.</p>
<p>For stream processing on Hadoop, natively Hadoop wont provide you with this kind of capabilities, but you can integrate some other projects with Hadoop easily:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://github.com/yahoo/storm-yarn rel=noreferrer>Storm-YARN</a> allows you to use Storm on your Hadoop cluster via YARN.</li>
<li><a href=http://spark.incubator.apache.org/ rel=noreferrer>Spark</a> integrates with HDFS to allow you to process streaming data in real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For real-time queries there are also several projects which use Hadoop:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://github.com/cloudera/impala rel=noreferrer>Impala</a> from Cloudera uses HDFS but bypasses MapReduce altogether because theres too much overhead otherwise.</li>
<li><a href=http://incubator.apache.org/drill/ rel=noreferrer>Apache Drill</a> is another project that integrates with Hadoop to provide real-time query capabilities.</li>
<li>The <a href=http://hortonworks.com/labs/stinger/ rel=noreferrer>Stinger</a> project aims to make Hive itself more real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably other projects that would fit into the list of Making Hadoop real-time, but these are the most well-known ones.</p>
<p>So as you can see, Hadoop is going more and more towards the direction of real-time and, even if it wasnt designed for that, you have plenty of opportunities to extend it for real-time purposes.</p>",,,hadoop real-time,Is Hadoop real-time?,"Hadoop was never built for real-time processing.
