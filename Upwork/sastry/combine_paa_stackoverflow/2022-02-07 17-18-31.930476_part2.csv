https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30042334/attribute-error-list-object-has-no-attribute-split,python - Attribute Error: list object has no attribute split,"<p>I think youve actually got a wider confusion here.</p>
<p>The initial error is that youre trying to call <code>split</code> on the whole list of lines, and you cant <code>split</code> a list of strings, only a string. So, you need to <code>split</code> <em>each line</em>, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then youre doing <code>for points in Type</code>, and expecting each such <code>points</code> to give you a new <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. But that isnt going to happen. <code>Types</code> is just two values, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, so first <code>points</code> will be <code>x</code>, and then points will be <code>y</code>, and then youll be done. So, again, you need to loop over each line and get the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values from <em>each line</em>, not loop over a single <code>Types</code> from a single line.</p>
<p>So, everything has to go inside a loop over every line in the file, and do the <code>split</code> into <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> once for each line. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>def getQuakeData():
    filename = input(Please enter the quake file: )
    readfile = open(filename, r)

    for line in readfile:
        Type = line.split(,)
        x = Type[1]
        y = Type[2]
        print(x,y)

getQuakeData()
</code></pre>
<p>As a side note, you really should <code>close</code> the file, ideally with a <code>with</code> statement, but Ill get to that at the end.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Interestingly, the problem here isnt that youre being too much of a newbie, but that youre trying to solve the problem in the same abstract way an expert would, and just dont know the details yet. This is completely doable; you just have to be explicit about mapping the functionality, rather than just doing it implicitly. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def getQuakeData():
    filename = input(Please enter the quake file: )
    readfile = open(filename, r)
    readlines = readfile.readlines()
    Types = [line.split(,) for line in readlines]
    xs = [Type[1] for Type in Types]
    ys = [Type[2] for Type in Types]
    for x, y in zip(xs, ys):
        print(x,y)

getQuakeData()
</code></pre>
<p>Or, a better way to write that might be:</p>
<pre><code>def getQuakeData():
    filename = input(Please enter the quake file: )
    # Use with to make sure the file gets closed
    with open(filename, r) as readfile:
        # no need for readlines; the file is already an iterable of lines
        # also, using generator expressions means no extra copies
        types = (line.split(,) for line in readfile)
        # iterate tuples, instead of two separate iterables, so no need for zip
        xys = ((type[1], type[2]) for type in types)
        for x, y in xys:
            print(x,y)

getQuakeData()
</code></pre>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25475384/when-and-why-do-i-need-to-use-cin-ignore-in-c/41191428,When and why do I need to use cin.ignore() in C++?,"<p>Ignore is exactly what the name implies.</p>
<p>It doesnt throw away something you dont need instead, it ignores the amount of characters you specify when you call it, up to the char you specify as a breakpoint.</p>
<p>It works with both input and output buffers. </p>
<p>Essentially, for <code>std::cin</code> statements you use ignore before you do a <code>getline</code> call, because when a user inputs something with <code>std::cin</code>, they hit enter and a <code>\n</code> char gets into the <code>cin</code> buffer. Then if you use <code>getline</code>, it gets the newline char instead of the string you want. So you do a <code>std::cin.ignore(1000,\n)</code> and that should clear the buffer up to the string that you want. (The 1000 is put there to skip over a specific amount of chars before the specified break point, in this case, the \n newline character.)</p>","<p>Youre thinking about this the wrong way. Youre thinking in logical steps each time <code>cin</code> or <code>getline</code> is used. Ex. First ask for a number, then ask for a name. That is the wrong way to think about <code>cin</code>. So you run into a race condition because you assume the stream is clear each time you ask for a input.</p>
<p>If you write your program purely for input youll find the problem:</p>
<pre><code>void main(void)
{
    double num;
    string mystr;

    cin &gt;&gt; num;
    getline(cin, mystr);

    cout &lt;&lt; num= &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; ,mystr=\ &lt;&lt; mystr &lt;&lt; \ &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above, you are thinking, first get a number. So you type in <code>123</code> press enter, and your output will be <code>num=123,mystr=</code>. Why is that? Its because in the stream you have <code>123\n</code> and the <code>123</code> is parsed into the <code>num</code> variable while <code>\n</code> is still in the stream. Reading the doc for <code>getline</code> function by default it will look in the <code>istream</code> until a <code>\n</code> is encountered. In this example, since <code>\n</code> is in the stream, it looks like it skipped it but it worked properly.</p>
<p>For the above to work, youll have to enter <code>123Hello World</code> which will properly output <code>num=123,mystr=Hello World</code>. That, or you put a <code>cin.ignore</code> between the <code>cin</code> and <code>getline</code> so that itll break into logical steps that you expect.</p>
<p>This is why you need the <code>ignore</code> command. Because you are thinking of it in logical steps rather than in a stream form so you run into a race condition.</p>
<p>Take another code example that is commonly found in schools:</p>
<pre><code>void main(void)
{
    int age;
    string firstName;
    string lastName;

    cout &lt;&lt; First name: ;
    cin &gt;&gt; firstName;

    cout &lt;&lt; Last name: ;
    cin &gt;&gt; lastName;

    cout &lt;&lt; Age: ;
    cin &gt;&gt; age;

    cout &lt;&lt; Hello  &lt;&lt; firstName &lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; lastName &lt;&lt; ! You are  &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt;  years old! &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above seems to be in logical steps. First ask for first name, last name, then age. So if you did <code>John</code> enter, then <code>Doe</code> enter, then <code>19</code> enter, the application works each logic step. If you think of it in streams you can simply enter <code>John Doe 19</code> on the First name: question and it would work as well and appear to skip the remaining questions. For the above to work in logical steps, you would need to <code>ignore</code> the remaining stream for each logical break in questions.</p>
<p>Just remember to think of your program input as it is reading from a stream and not in logical steps. Each time you call <code>cin</code> it is being read from a stream. This creates a rather buggy application if the user enters the wrong input. For example, if you entered a character where a <code>cin &gt;&gt; double</code> is expected, the application will produce a seemingly bizarre output.</p>",cin.ignore(),What does Cin ignore () mean in C++?,"The cin. ignore() function is used which is used to ignore or clear one or more characters from the input buffer. ... For example, after entering into the cin statement, we need to input a character array or string. So we need to clear the input buffer, otherwise it will occupy the buffer of previous variable.",Where do I put CIN ignore?,A very common use case is using this to safely ignore newline characters since cin will sometimes leave newline characters that you will have to go over to get to the next line of input. Adding cin. ignore() to the next line clears/ignores the newline from the stream.,When to use CIN clear and CIN ignore?,"clear() helps in clearing the error flags which are set when std::cin fails to interpret the input. cin. ignore(), on the other hand helps in removing the input contents that could caused the read failure.",What does Cin get () do?,"get() is used for accessing character array. It includes white space characters. Generally, cin with an extraction operator (>>) terminates when whitespace is found.","<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>
<p>Why?  Because there is still whitespace (carriage returns, tabs, spaces, newline) left in the input stream.</p>
<p>When?  When you are using some function which does not on their own ignores the leading whitespaces. Cin by default ignores and removes the leading whitespace but getline does not ignore the leading whitespace on its own.</p>
<p><strong>Now a detailed answer.</strong></p>
<p>Everything you input in the console is read from the standard stream stdin. When you enter something, lets say 256 in your case and press enter, the contents of the stream become <code>256\n</code>. Now cin picks up 256 and removes it from the stream and <code>\n</code> still remaining in the stream.
Now next when you enter your name, lets say <code>Raddicus</code>, the new contents of the stream is <code>\nRaddicus</code>.</p>
<p>Now here comes the catch.
When you try to read a line using getline, if not provided any delimiter as the third argument, getline by default reads till the newline character and removes the newline character from the stream.
So on calling new line, getline reads and discards <code>\n</code> from the stream and resulting in an empty string read in mystr which appears like getline is skipped (but its not) because there was already an newline in the stream, getline will not prompt for input as it has already read what it was supposed to read.</p>
<p><strong>Now, how does cin.ignore help here?</strong></p>
<p>According to the ignore documentation extract from <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/ignore/ rel=noreferrer>cplusplus.com</a>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>istream&amp; ignore (streamsize n = 1, int delim = EOF);</strong></p>
<p>Extracts characters from the input sequence and discards them, until
  either n characters have been extracted, or one compares equal to
  delim.</p>
<p>The function also stops extracting characters if the end-of-file is
  reached. If this is reached prematurely (before either extracting n
  characters or finding delim), the function sets the eofbit flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <code>cin.ignore(256, \n);</code>, ignores first 256 characters or all the character untill it encounters delimeter (here \n in your case), whichever comes first (here \n is the first character, so it ignores until \n is encountered).</p>
<p>Just for your reference, If you dont exactly know how many characters to skip and your sole purpose is to clear the stream to prepare for reading a string using getline or cin you should use <code>cin.ignore(numeric_limits&lt;streamsize&gt;::max(),\n)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Quick explanation:</strong> It ignores the characters equal to maximum size of stream or until a \n is encountered, whichever case happens first.</p>"

<p>Technically, the answer would be <strong>no, its not needed</strong> because its expressible using other constructs. But in practice, I use <code>for i in range(len(a)</code> (or <code>for _ in range(len(a))</code> if I dont need the index) to make it explicit that I want to iterate as many times as there are items in a sequence without needing to use the items in the sequence for anything.</p>
