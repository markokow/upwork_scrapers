https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39008821/tensorflow-when-use-tf-expand-dims,Tensorflow: When use tf.expand_dims?,"<p><code>expand_dims</code> will not add or reduce elements in a tensor, it just changes the shape by adding <code>1</code> to dimensions. For example, a vector with 10 elements could be treated as a 10x1 matrix.</p>
<p>The situation I have met to use <code>expand_dims</code> is when I tried to build a ConvNet to classify grayscale images. The grayscale images will be loaded as matrix of size <code>[320, 320]</code>. However, <code>tf.nn.conv2d</code> require input to be <code>[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]</code>, where the <code>in_channels</code> dimension is missing in my data which in this case should be <code>1</code>. So I used <code>expand_dims</code> to add one more dimension.</p>
<p>In your case, I do not think you need <code>expand_dims</code>.</p>","<p>To add to Da Tongs answer, you may want to expand more than one dimension at the same time. For instance, if you are performing TensorFlows <code>conv1d</code> operation on vectors of rank 1, you need to feed them with rank three.</p>

<pre class=lang-py prettyprint-override><code>import tensorflow as tf

# having some tensor of rank 1, it could be an audio signal, a word vector...
tensor = tf.ones(100)
print(tensor.get_shape()) # =&gt; (100,)

tensor_expand = tf.expand_dims(tensor, 0)
tensor_expand = tf.expand_dims(tensor_expand, 0)
tensor_expand = tf.expand_dims(tensor_expand, -1)
print(tensor_expand.get_shape()) # =&gt; (1, 1, 100, 1)

# do the same in one line with reshape
tensor_reshape = tf.reshape(tensor, [1, 1, tensor.get_shape().as_list()[0],1])

<h2><code>useImperativeHandle</code></h2>
<p>Usually when you use <code>useRef</code> you are given the instance value of the component the <code>ref</code> is attached to. This allows you to interact with the DOM element directly.</p>
<p><code>useImperativeHandle</code> is very similar, but it lets you do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It gives you control over the value that is returned. Instead of returning the instance element, you explicitly state what the return value will be (see snippet below).</li>
<li>It allows you to replace native functions (such as <code>blur</code>, <code>focus</code>, etc) with functions of your own, thus allowing side-effects to the normal behavior, or a different behavior altogether. Though, you can call the function whatever you like.</li>
</ol>
<p>There could be many reasons you want might to do either of the above; you might not want to expose native properties to the parent or maybe you want to change the behavior of a native function. There could be many reasons. However, <code>useImperativeHandle</code> is rarely used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>useImperativeHandle</code> customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using <code>ref</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>In this example, the value well get from the <code>ref</code> will only contain the function <code>blur</code> which we declared in our <code>useImperativeHandle</code>. It will not contain any other properties (<em>I am logging the value to demonstrate this</em>). The function itself is also customized to behave differently than what youd normally expect. Here, it sets <code>document.title</code> and blurs the input when <code>blur</code> is invoked.</p>

<h2><code>useLayoutEffect</code></h2>
<p>While similar to some extent to <code>useEffect()</code>, it differs in that it will run after React has committed updates to the DOM. Used in rare cases when you need to calculate the distance between elements after an update or do other post-update calculations / side-effects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The signature is identical to <code>useEffect</code>, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. Updates scheduled inside <code>useLayoutEffect</code> will be flushed synchronously, <strong>before the browser has a chance to paint</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have a absolutely positioned element whose height might vary and you want to position another <code>div</code> beneath it. You could use <code>getBoundingCLientRect()</code> to calculate the parents height and top properties and then just apply those to the top property of the child.</p>
<p>Here you would want to use <code>useLayoutEffect</code> rather than <code>useEffect</code>. See why in the examples below:</p>

<h2><code>useDebugValue</code></h2>
<p>Sometimes you might want to debug certain values or properties, but doing so might require expensive operations which might impact performance.</p>
<p><code>useDebugValue</code> is only called when the React DevTools are open and the related hook is inspected, preventing any impact on performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>useDebugValue</code> can be used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have personally never used this hook though. Maybe someone in the comments can give some insight with a good example.</p>","<h2><code>useImperativeHandle</code></h2>
<p><code>useImperativeHandle</code> allows you to determine which properties will be exposed on a ref. In the example below, we have a button component, and wed like to expose the <code>someExposedProperty</code> property on that ref:</p>
<p><strong>[index.tsx]</strong></p>
<pre><code>import React, { useRef } from react;
import { render } from react-dom;

function App() {

    console.log(click in index.tsx);
    buttonRef.current.someExposedProperty();
  };

  return (

<h2><code>useLayoutEffect</code></h2>
<p>This is the same as <code>useEffect</code>, but only fires once all DOM mutations are completed. <a href=https://kentcdodds.com/blog/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect rel=noreferrer>This article</a> From Kent C. Dodds explains the difference as well as anyone, regarding these two, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>99% of the time [<code>useEffect</code>] is what you want to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I havent seen any examples which illustrate this particularly well, and Im not sure Id be able to create anything either. Its probably best to say that you ought to only use <code>useLayoutEffect</code> when <code>useEffect</code> has issues.</p>
<h2><code>useDebugValue</code></h2>
<p>I feel like <a href=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usedebugvalue rel=noreferrer>the docs</a> do a pretty good example of explaining this one. If you have a custom hook, and youd like to label it within React DevTools, then this is what you use.</p>
<p>If you have any specific issues with this then itd probably be best to either comment or ask another question, because I feel like anything people put here will just be reiterating the docs, at least until we reach a more specific problem.</p>","<p>The <code>useImperativeHandle</code> hook helped me a lot with a use case of mine.</p>
<p>I created a grid component which uses a third-party library component. The library itself has a big data layer with built-in functionality that can be used by accessing the instance of the element.</p>
<p>However, in my own grid component, I want to extend it with methods which perform actions on the grid. Furthermore, I also want to be able to execute those methods from outside of my grid component.</p>
<p>This is easily achievable by adding the methods inside of the <code>useImperativeHandle</code> hook, and then they will be exposed and usable by its parent.</p>
<p>My grid component looks kind of like this:</p>
<pre class=lang-js prettyprint-override><code>import React, { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, useRef } from react;
import ThirdPartyGrid from some-library;

export default forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) =&gt; {

        () =&gt; ({

            storeExpandedRecords () {
                // Some code
            },

            restoreExpandedRecords () {
                // Some code
            },

        }));
    
    return (
        &lt;div ref={forwardedRef}&gt;
            &lt;ThirdPartyGrid 
                ref={gridRef}
                {...props.config}
            /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
});

</code></pre>
<p>And then in my parent, I can execute those methods:</p>
<pre class=lang-js prettyprint-override><code>import React, { useRef, useEffect } from react;

export default function Parent () {
    const gridRef = useRef(null);

    const storeRecords = () =&gt; {

<p>If you still want to calculate the values yourself, you can use <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization rel=noreferrer>memoization</a>:</p>
<pre><code>var f = [];
function factorial (n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1)
    return 1;
  if (f[n] &gt; 0)
    return f[n];
  return f[n] = factorial(n-1) * n;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Edit: 21.08.2014</h2>
<h3>Solution 2</h3>
<p>I thought it would be useful to add a working example of <strong>lazy</strong> <strong>iterative</strong> <strong>factorial function</strong> that uses <strong>big numbers</strong> to get <strong>exact</strong> result with <strong>memoization</strong> and <strong>cache</strong> as comparison</p>
<pre><code>var f = [new BigNumber(1), new BigNumber(1)];
var i = 2;
function factorial(n)
{
  if (typeof f[n] != undefined)
    return f[n];
  var result = f[i-1];
  for (; i &lt;= n; i++)
      f[i] = result = result.multiply(i.toString());
  return result;
}
var cache = 100;
// Due to memoization, following line will cache first 100 elements.
factorial(cache);

<p><strong>My results show:</strong><br/>

- <strong>Iterative</strong> ~ 5 milliseconds..</p>","<p>I still think Marguss answer is the best one. However if you want to calculate the factorials of numbers within the range 0 to 1 (ie the gamma function) as well, then you cannot use that approach because the lookup table will have to contain infinite values.</p>
<p>However, you <em>can</em> approximate the values of the factorials, and its pretty fast, faster than recursively calling itself or looping it at least (especially when values start to get bigger).</p>
<p>A good approximation method is Lanczoss one</p>
<p>Here is an implementation in JavaScript (ported from a calculator I wrote months ago):</p>
<pre><code>function factorial(op) {
 // Lanczos Approximation of the Gamma Function
 // As described in Numerical Recipes in C (2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, 1992)
 var z = op + 1;
 var p = [1.000000000190015, 76.18009172947146, -86.50532032941677, 24.01409824083091, -1.231739572450155, 1.208650973866179E-3, -5.395239384953E-6];

 var d1 = Math.sqrt(2 * Math.PI) / z;
 var d2 = p[0];

 for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 6; ++i)
  d2 += p[i] / (z + i);

 var d3 = Math.pow((z + 5.5), (z + 0.5));
 var d4 = Math.exp(-(z + 5.5));

 d = d1 * d2 * d3 * d4;

 return d;

</code></pre>
<p>Which is what the other answer says. You could replace max(x) with any variable and it would cancel out.</p>","<p>(Well... much confusion here, both in the question and in the answers...)</p>
<p>To start with, the two solutions (i.e. yours and the suggested one) are <strong>not</strong> equivalent; they <strong>happen</strong> to be equivalent only for the special case of 1-D score arrays. You would have discovered it if you had tried also the 2-D score array in the Udacity quiz provided example.</p>
<p>Results-wise, the only actual difference between the two solutions is the <code>axis=0</code> argument. To see that this is the case, lets try your solution (<code>your_softmax</code>) and one where the only difference is the <code>axis</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

# your solution:
def your_softmax(x):
    Compute softmax values for each sets of scores in x.
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum()

# correct solution:
def softmax(x):
    Compute softmax values for each sets of scores in x.
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=0) # only difference
</code></pre>
<p>As I said, for a 1-D score array, the results are indeed identical:</p>
<pre><code>scores = [3.0, 1.0, 0.2]
print(your_softmax(scores))
# [ 0.8360188   0.11314284  0.05083836]
print(softmax(scores))
# [ 0.8360188   0.11314284  0.05083836]
your_softmax(scores) == softmax(scores)
# array([ True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)
</code></pre>
<p>Nevertheless, here are the results for the 2-D score array given in the Udacity quiz as a test example:</p>
<pre><code>scores2D = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 6],
                     [2, 4, 5, 6],
                     [3, 8, 7, 6]])

</code></pre>
<p>The results are different - the second one is indeed identical with the one expected in the Udacity quiz, where all columns indeed sum to 1, which is not the case with the first (wrong) result.</p>
<p>So, all the fuss was actually for an implementation detail - the <code>axis</code> argument. According to the <a href=http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html rel=noreferrer>numpy.sum documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default, axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input array</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while here we want to sum row-wise, hence <code>axis=0</code>. For a 1-D array, the sum of the (only) row and the sum of all the elements happen to be identical, hence your identical results in that case...</p>
<p>The <code>axis</code> issue aside, your implementation (i.e. your choice to subtract the max first) is actually <strong>better</strong> than the suggested solution! In fact, it is the recommended way of implementing the softmax function - see <a href=http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/#softmax rel=noreferrer>here</a> for the justification (numeric stability, also pointed out by some other answers here).</p>","<p>So, this is really a comment to desertnauts answer but I cant comment on it yet due to my reputation. As he pointed out, your version is only correct if your input consists of a single sample. If your input consists of several samples, it is wrong. <strong>However, desertnauts solution is also wrong.</strong> The problem is that once he takes a 1-dimensional input and then he takes a 2-dimensional input. Let me show this to you.</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

# your solution:
def your_softmax(x):
    Compute softmax values for each sets of scores in x.
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum()

# desertnaut solution (copied from his answer): 
def desertnaut_softmax(x):
    Compute softmax values for each sets of scores in x.
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=0) # only difference

# my (correct) solution:
def softmax(z):
    assert len(z.shape) == 2
    s = np.max(z, axis=1)
    s = s[:, np.newaxis] # necessary step to do broadcasting
    e_x = np.exp(z - s)
    div = np.sum(e_x, axis=1)
    div = div[:, np.newaxis] # dito
    return e_x / div
</code></pre>
<p>Lets take desertnauts example:</p>
<pre><code>x1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 6]]) # notice that we put the data into 2 dimensions(!)
</code></pre>
<p>This is the output:</p>
<pre><code>your_softmax(x1)
array([[ 0.00626879,  0.01704033,  0.04632042,  0.93037047]])

softmax(x1)
array([[ 0.00626879,  0.01704033,  0.04632042,  0.93037047]])
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that desernauts version would fail in this situation. (It would not if the input was just one dimensional like np.array([1, 2, 3, 6]).</p>
<p>Lets now use 3 samples since thats the reason why we use a 2 dimensional input. The following x2 is not the same as the one from desernauts example. </p>
<pre><code>x2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 6],  # sample 1
               [2, 4, 5, 6],  # sample 2
               [1, 2, 3, 6]]) # sample 1 again(!)
</code></pre>
<p>This input consists of a batch with 3 samples. But sample one and three are essentially the same. We now expect 3 rows of softmax activations where the first should be the same as the third and also the same as our activation of x1!</p>
