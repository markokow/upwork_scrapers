New users who encounter this problem may be confused about the mentions of using GOPATH (as was I), which are now outdated. So, I will try to clear up this issue and provide guidance associated with preventing this issue when using Go modules.</p>\n<p>If youre already familiar with Go modules and are experiencing this issue, skip down to my more specific sections below that cover some of the Go conventions that are easy to overlook or forget.</p>\n<p>This guide teaches about Go modules: <a href=https://golang.org/doc/code.html rel=noreferrer>https://golang.org/doc/code.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>Project organization with Go modules</strong></p>\n<p>Once you migrate to Go modules, as mentioned in that article, organize the project code as described:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A repository contains one or more modules. A module is a collection of\nrelated Go packages that are released together. A Go repository\ntypically contains only one module, located at the root of the\nrepository. A file named go.mod there declares the module path: the\nimport path prefix for all packages within the module. The module\ncontains the packages in the directory containing its go.mod file as\nwell as subdirectories of that directory, up to the next subdirectory\ncontaining another go.mod file (if any).</p>\n<p>Each modules path not only serves as an import path prefix for its\npackages, but also indicates where the go command should look to\ndownload it. For example, in order to download the module\ngolang.org/x/tools, the go command would consult the repository\nindicated by <a href=https://golang.org/x/tools rel=noreferrer>https://golang.org/x/tools</a> (described more here).</p>\n<p>An import path is a string used to import a package. A packages\nimport path is its module path joined with its subdirectory within the\nmodule. For example, the module github.com/google/go-cmp contains a\npackage in the directory cmp/. That packages import path is\ngithub.com/google/go-cmp/cmp. Packages in the standard library do not\nhave a module path prefix.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can initialize your module like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ go mod init github.com/mitchell/foo-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your code doesnt need to be located on github.com for it to build. However, its a best practice to structure your modules as if they will eventually be published.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding what happens when trying to get a package</strong></p>\n<p>Theres a great article here that talks about what happens when you try to get a package or module: <a href=https://medium.com/rungo/anatomy-of-modules-in-go-c8274d215c16 rel=noreferrer>https://medium.com/rungo/anatomy-of-modules-in-go-c8274d215c16</a>\nIt discusses where the package is stored and will help you understand why you might be getting this error if youre already using Go modules.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensure the imported function has been exported</strong></p>\n<p>Note that if youre having trouble accessing a function from another file, you need to ensure that youve exported your function. As described in the first link I provided, a function must begin with an upper-case letter to be exported and made available for importing into other packages.</p>\n<p><strong>Names of directories</strong></p>\n<p>Another critical detail (as was mentioned in the accepted answer) is that names of directories are what define the names of your packages. (Your package names need to match their directory names.) You can see examples of this here: <a href=https://medium.com/rungo/everything-you-need-to-know-about-packages-in-go-b8bac62b74cc rel=noreferrer>https://medium.com/rungo/everything-you-need-to-know-about-packages-in-go-b8bac62b74cc</a>\nWith that said, the file containing your <code>main</code> method (i.e., the entry point of your application) is sort of exempt from this requirement.</p>\n<p>As an example, I had problems with my imports when using a structure like this:</p>\n<pre><code>/my-app\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 go.mod\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 /src\n   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main.go\n   \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 /utils\n      \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 utils.go\n</code></pre>\n<p>I was unable to import the code in <code>utils</code> into my <code>main</code> package.</p>\n<p>However, once I put <code>main.go</code> into its own subdirectory, as shown below, my imports worked just fine:</p>\n<pre><code>/my-app\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 go.mod\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 /src\n   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 /app\n   |  \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main.go\n   \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 /utils\n      \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 utils.go\n</code></pre>\n<p>In that example, my go.mod file looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>module git.mydomain.com/path/to/repo/my-app\n\ngo 1.14\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I saved main.go after adding a reference to <code>utils.MyFunction()</code>, my IDE automatically pulled in the reference to my package like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import git.mydomain.com/path/to/repo/my-app/src/my-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Im using VS Code with the Golang extension.)</p>\n<p>Notice that the import path included the subdirectory to the package.</p>\n<p><strong>Dealing with a private repo</strong></p>\n<p>If the code is part of a private repo, you need to run a git command to enable access. Otherwise, you can encounter other errors This article mentions how to do that for private Github, BitBucket, and GitLab repos: <a href=https://medium.com/cloud-native-the-gathering/go-modules-with-private-git-repositories-dfe795068db4 rel=noreferrer>https://medium.com/cloud-native-the-gathering/go-modules-with-private-git-repositories-dfe795068db4</a>\nThis issue is also discussed here: <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27500861/whats-the-proper-way-to-go-get-a-private-repository>Whats the proper way to go get a private repository?</a></p>'","b'<p>I solved this problem by set my go env GO111MODULE to off</p>\n<pre><code>go env -w  GO111MODULE=off\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: setting GO111MODULE=off will turn off the latest GO Modules feature.</p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=https://maelvls.dev/go111module-everywhere/ rel=nofollow noreferrer>Why is GO111MODULE everywhere, and everything about Go Modules (updated with Go 1.17)</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>GO111MODULE with Go 1.16</strong></p>\n<p>As of Go 1.16, the default behavior is GO111MODULE=on, meaning that if\nyou want to keep using the old GOPATH way, you will have to force Go\nnot to use the Go Modules feature:</p>\n<p>export GO111MODULE=off</p>\n</blockquote>'",go cannot find package,Where does Go look for packages?,"Go first searches for package directory inside GOROOT/src directory and if it doesn't find the package, then it looks for GOPATH/src .

The MongoDB driver, mgo, provides two packages that we have imported in the above import statement.",What should Goroot and Gopath be set to?,"GOPATH must be set to get, build and install packages outside the standard Go tree. GOROOT is discussed in the installation instructions: The Go binary distributions assume they will be installed in /usr/local/go (or c:\Go under Windows), but it is possible to install the Go tools to a different location."

3,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18286432/vb-net-opening-and-closing-forms,winforms - VB.net opening and closing forms,"b'<blockquote>\n<p>But everytime i switch forms the form load event will only trigger once. Is there something wrong with my code? I am guesing the Me.Hide() will only hide the previous form and not totally close it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is exactly what is happening. The <code>Hide</code> method just <em>hides</em> the form from the user, effectively making it invisible.</p>\n<p>What youre looking for is the <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.close.aspx rel=noreferrer><code>Close</code> method</a>, which actually closes the form. (Since you are displaying the form using the <code>Show</code> method, you do not need to call <code>Dispose</code>.)</p>\n<p>You will, however, not be able to close a form and continue to run code in its methods. So youll need to reverse the order of the statements in your event handler functions, displaying the other form <em>first</em> and then closing itself. Make them look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click\n    Form1.Show()\n    Me.Close()    \nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click\n    Form2.Show()\n    Me.Close()\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n<p>That will do what you want. The <code>Load</code> event will be triggered each time you call the <code>Show</code> method, because youre creating and showing a new form.</p>\n<p>It is worth pointing out, though, that youre relying on an unusual characteristic of VB.NET, one that it retains from the older VB languages for backwards compatibility reasons. Instead of referring to an <em>object</em> of your form class (like you would have to do with all other class objects), you are referring to it by the <em>type</em> name (the name of the class itself). You really shouldnt do that, it causes all sorts of headaches and will confuse people reading your code. It is better to just instantiate a new form object, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click\n    Dim frm As New Form1   create a new Form1 object\n    frm.Show()             ... and display it\n\n    Me.Close()\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click\n    Dim frm As New Form1   create a new Form2 object\n    frm.Show()             ... and display it\n\n    Me.Close()\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you run this code, you will likely run immediately into another problem: the first time you close <code>Form1</code>, your entire application will quit. This is because, by default for a new project, <code>Form1</code> is designated as the Startup form in your projects properties (My Project in the Solution Explorer). You will either have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a <em>third</em> form to use as the main form, and set the Startup form to this third form, or</li>\n<li>change the Shutdown mode (also in My Project) from When startup form closes to When last form closes.</li>\n</ul>'","b'<blockquote>\n<p>I am guesing the Me.Hide() will only hide the previous form and not totally close it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, it does what it says.  If you want to close the form then use Me.Close() instead.  The Load event will fire again when you create the new instance.</p>\n<p>Youll have to change a setting to ensure that doesnt also close your application.  Project + Properties, Application tab, change the Shutdown mode setting to When last form closes.  And put the Me.Close() call <em>after</em> the Show() call.</p>'",b'<p>I also had a similar question. When u <code>.Hide()</code> you are just storing it away in memory somewhere such that when it is re-opened it doesnt have to make a new form just recalls the one from memory hence that method is not called again. You have to destroy the form. So what you can do when navigating to another form is go to that form first and then destroy the current form like so <br/> <code>Form2.Show()</code><br/><code>Me.Close()</code>.
