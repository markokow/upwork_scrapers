https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7760951/gettimeofday-c-inconsistency,time - gettimeofday() C++ Inconsistency,"<p>Assuming youre talking about the <em>resolution</em> of the data returned, <a href=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/functions/gettimeofday.html rel=nofollow noreferrer>the POSIX specification</a> for <code>gettimeofday</code> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The resolution of the system clock is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is due to the fact that systems may have a widely varying capacity for tracking small time periods. Even the ISO standard <code>clock()</code> function includes caveats like this.</p>
<p>If youre talking about how <em>long</em> it takes to call it, the standard makes no guarantees about performance along those lines. An implementation is perfectly free to wait 125 <em>minutes</em> before giving you the time although I doubt such an implementation would have much market success :-)</p>
<hr/>
<p>As an example of the limited resolution, I typed in the following code to check it on my system:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

#define NUMBER 30

int main (void) {
    struct timeval tv[NUMBER];
    int count[NUMBER], i, diff;

    gettimeofday (&amp;tv[0], NULL);

    for (i = 1; i &lt; NUMBER; i++) {
        gettimeofday (&amp;tv[i], NULL);
        count[i] = 1;
        while ((tv[i].tv_sec == tv[i-1].tv_sec) &amp;&amp;
            (tv[i].tv_usec == tv[i-1].tv_usec))
        {
            count[i]++;
            gettimeofday (&amp;tv[i], NULL);
        }
    }

    printf (%2d: secs = %d, usecs = %6d\n, 0, tv[0].tv_sec, tv[0].tv_usec);
    for (i = 1; i &lt; NUMBER; i++) {
        diff = (tv[i].tv_sec - tv[i-1].tv_sec) * 1000000;
        diff += tv[i].tv_usec - tv[i-1].tv_usec;

        printf (%2d: secs = %d, usecs = %6d, count = %5d, diff = %d\n,
            i, tv[i].tv_sec, tv[i].tv_usec, count[i], diff);
    }

    return 0;
}

<p>The code basically records the changes in the underlying time, keeping a count of how many calls it took to <code>gettimeofday()</code> for the time to actually change. This is on a reasonably powerful machine so its not short on processing power (the count indicates how often it was able to call <code>gettimeofday()</code> for each time quantum, around the 5,800 mark, ignoring the first since we dont know <em>when</em> in that quantum we started the measurements).</p>

<p>showing that the resolution seems to be limited to no better than one thousand microseconds. Of course, your system may be different to that, the bottom line is that it depends on your implementation and/or environment.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One way to get around this type of limitation is to not do something once but to do it <code>N</code> times and then divide the elapsed time by <code>N</code>.</p>
<p>For example, lets say you call your function and the timer says it took 125 milliseconds, something that you suspect seems a little high. I would suggest then calling it a thousand times in a loop, measuring the time it took for the entire thousand.</p>
<p>If that turns out to be 125 seconds then, yes, its probably slow. However, if it takes only 27 seconds, that would indicate your timer resolution is whats causing the seemingly large times, since that would equate to 27 milliseconds per iteration, on par with what youre seeing from the other results.</p>
<p>Modifying your code to take this into account would be along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>int main() {
    const int count = 1000;
    timeval tim;

    gettimeofday(&amp;tim, NULL);
    double t1 = 1.0e6 * tim.tv_sec + tim.tv_usec;

    int v;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i)
        v = a(3, 4);           

    gettimeofday(&amp;tim, NULL);
    double t2 = 1.0e6 * tim.tv_sec + tim.tv_usec;

    cout &lt;&lt; v &lt;&lt; \n &lt;&lt; ((t2 - t1) / count) &lt;&lt; \n;

    return 0;
}

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1319074/parallel-python-what-is-a-callback,Parallel Python: What is a callback?,"<p>A callback is a function provided by the consumer of an API that the API can then turn around and invoke (calling you back). If I setup a Dr.s appointment, I can give them my phone number, so they can call me the day before to confirm the appointment. A callback is like that, except instead of just being a phone number, it can be arbitrary instructions like send me an email at this address, and also call my secretary and have her put it in my calendar. </p>
<p>Callbacks are often used in situations where an action is asynchronous. If you need to call a function, and immediately continue working, you cant sit there wait for its return value to let you know what happened, so you provide a callback. When the function is done completely its asynchronous work it will then invoke your callback with some predetermined arguments (usually some you supply, and some about the status and result of the asynchronous action you requested). </p>
<p>If the Dr. is out of the office, or they are still working on the schedule, rather than having me wait on hold until he gets back, which could be several hours, we hang up, and once the appointment has been scheduled, they call me.</p>
<p>In this specific case, Parallel Pythons submit function will invoke your callback with any arguments you supply and the result of <code>func</code>, once <code>func</code> has finished executing.</p>",python callback,What is a callback in Python?,"In Python, a callback is simply a function or a method passed to LocalSolver. A callback takes two parameters: the LocalSolver object that triggers the event and the type of the callback. It is possible to use the same callback method or object for multiple events or multiple LocalSolver instances.",Is there callback in Python?,"In the Parallel Python Module, the submit function is known as the callback function. The callback function acts as an argument for any other function. The other function in which the callback function is an argument calls the callback function in its function definition. Callback Function Definition in Python In the Parallel Python Module, the submit function is known as the callback function. The callback function acts as an argument for any other function. The other function in which the callback function is an argument calls the callback function in its function definition.",Why do we use callbacks?,Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.,What is a callback in programming?,"In computer programming, a callback, also known as a ""call-after"" function, is any reference to executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the code at a given time.","<p>The relevant spot in the docs:</p>
<pre><code>callback - callback function which will be called with argument 
        list equal to callbackargs+(result,) 
        as soon as calculation is done
callbackargs - additional arguments for callback function
</code></pre>
<p>So, if you want some code to be executed as soon as the result is ready, you put that code into a function and pass that function as the <code>callback</code> argument. If you dont need other arguments, it will be just, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>def itsdone(result):
  print Done! result=%r % (result,)
...
submit(..., callback=itsdone)
</code></pre>
<p>For more on the <code>callback</code> pattern in Python, see e.g. my presentation <a href=http://www.listal.com/video/8878369 rel=noreferrer>here</a>.</p>","<p>Looking at the link, just looks like a hook which is called.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>callback - callback function which
  will be called with argument 
          list equal to callbackargs+(result,) 
          as soon as calculation is done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The as soon as calculation is done bit seems ambiguous. The point, as far as I can see of this thing is that the <code>submit()</code> call distributes work to other servers and then returns. Because the finishing is asynchronous, rather block, it allows you to provide a function which is called when some unit of work finishes. If you do:</p>
<pre><code>submit( ..., callback=work_finished, ... )
</code></pre>
<p>Then submit will ensure <code>work_finished()</code> is called when the unit of distributed work is completed on the target server.</p>
<p>When you call <code>submit()</code> you can provide a <strong>callback</strong> which is called in the same runtime as the caller of <code>submit()</code> ... and it is called after the distribution of the workload function is complete.</p>
<p>Kind of like call foo(x,y) when you have done some stuff in submit()</p>
<p>But yea, the documentation could be better. Have a ganders at the ppython source and see at which point the callback is called in <code>submit()</code></p>"

scanf",How do you print a variable in C?,"We use printf() function with %d format specifier to display the value of an integer variable.

<p>In printf() they behave identically so you can use any either %d or %i. But they behave differently in scanf().</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
    int num,num2;
    scanf(%d%i,&amp;num,&amp;num2);// reading num using %d and num2 using %i

    printf(%d\t%d,num,num2);

<p><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/23R63.png/></p>
<p>You can see the different results for identical inputs. </p>
<p><strong><code>num</code></strong>:</p>
<p>We are reading <code>num</code> using <code>%d</code> so when we enter <code>010</code> it ignores the first <code>0</code> and treats it as decimal <code>10</code>. </p>
<p><strong><code>num2</code></strong>:</p>
<p>We are reading <code>num2</code> using <code>%i</code>.</p>
<p>That means it will treat decimals, octals, and hexadecimals differently.</p>
<p>When it give <code>num2</code> <code>010</code> it sees the leading <code>0</code> and parses it as octal.</p>

<p>As some other wrote in their answer, the idiomatic way to print an <code>int</code> is using <code>d</code> conversion specifier. </p>
<p>Regarding <code>i</code> specifier and <code>fprintf</code>, C99 Rationale says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The %i conversion specifier was added in C89 for programmer convenience to provide 
  symmetry with fscanf’s %i conversion specifier, even though it has exactly the same meaning 
  as the %d conversion specifier when used with fprintf.   </p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42163846/positional-argument-follows-keyword-argument,python - positional argument follows keyword argument,"<p>The <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls rel=noreferrer>grammar of the language</a> specifies that positional arguments appear before keyword or starred arguments in calls:</p>
<pre><code>argument_list        ::=  positional_arguments [, starred_and_keywords]
                            [, keywords_arguments]
                          | starred_and_keywords [, keywords_arguments]
                          | keywords_arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Specifically, a keyword argument looks like this: <code>tag=insider trading!</code>
while a positional argument looks like this: <code>..., exchange, ...</code>. The problem lies in that you appear to have copy/pasted the parameter list, and left some of the default values in place, which makes them look like keyword arguments rather than positional ones. This is fine, except that you then go back to using positional arguments, which is a syntax error.</p>
<p>Also, when an argument has a <em>default value</em>, such as <code>price=None</code>, that means you dont have to provide it. If you dont provide it, it will use the default value instead. </p>
<p>To resolve this error, convert your later positional arguments into keyword arguments, or, if they have default values and you dont need to use them, simply dont specify them at all:</p>
<pre><code>order_id = kite.order_place(self, exchange, tradingsymbol,
    transaction_type, quantity)

# Fully positional:
order_id = kite.order_place(self, exchange, tradingsymbol, transaction_type, quantity, price, product, order_type, validity, disclosed_quantity, trigger_price, squareoff_value, stoploss_value, trailing_stoploss, variety, tag)

# Some positional, some keyword (all keywords at end):

order_id = kite.order_place(self, exchange, tradingsymbol,
    transaction_type, quantity, tag=insider trading!)
</code></pre>",syntaxerror positional argument follows keyword argument,syntaxerror positional argument follows keyword argument,The error positional argument follows keyword argument means that the if any keyword argument is used in the function call then it should always be followed by keyword arguments. Positional arguments can be written in the beginning before any keyword argument is passed.,Can keyword arguments be followed by positional arguments?,Keyword arguments are passed to functions after any required positional arguments. But the order of one keyword argument compared to another keyword argument does not matter.,How do keyword arguments differ from positional arguments?,A positional argument is a name that is not followed by an equal sign (=) and default value.
