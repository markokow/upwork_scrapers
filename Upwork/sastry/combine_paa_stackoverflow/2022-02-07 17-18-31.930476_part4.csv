https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4528744/how-does-the-extend-function-work-in-jquery,How does the extend() function work in jQuery?,"<h1>Multiple Parameters</h1>
<p>The documentation isnt precise in explaining how extend works, so I ran a little test:</p>
<pre><code>var a = {foo: 1, bar: 1};
var b = {foo: 2, baz: 2};
var c = {foo: 3};
var r = jQuery.extend(a,b,c);
console.log(A: Foo= + a.foo +  Bar= + a.bar +  Baz= + a.baz);
console.log(B: Foo= + b.foo +  Bar= + b.bar +  Baz= + b.baz);
console.log(C: Foo= + c.foo +  Bar= + c.bar +  Baz= + c.baz);
console.log(R: Foo= + r.foo +  Bar= + r.bar +  Baz= + r.baz);
console.log(A === R?:  + (a === r));
</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>console.log</code> function is intended to work in Firebug; replace it with alert() or some other output function if you like).</p>
<p>The results are:</p>
<pre><code>A: Foo=3 Bar=1 Baz=2
B: Foo=2 Bar=undefined Baz=2
C: Foo=3 Bar=undefined Baz=undefined
R: Foo=3 Bar=1 Baz=2
A === R?: true
</code></pre>
<p>By this we can see that jQuery.extend():</p>
<ul>
<li>Starts with the object provided by the first parameter.</li>
<li>Adds to it any property in the second parameter. If the property already exists in the first parameter, it is overwritten. The object for the second parameter is unchanged.</li>
<li>Repeats the above with any subsequent parameter.</li>
<li>Returns the first parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is useful for combining user and default option-objects together to get a complete set of options:</p>
<pre><code>function foo(userOptions) {
  var defaultOptions = {
    foo: 2,
    bar: 2
  };
  var someOtherDefaultOptions = {
    baz: 3
  };

  var allOptions = jQuery.extend(
    defaultOptions,
    someOtherDefaultOptions,
    userOptions
  );
  doSomething(allOptions);
}

foo({foo:1, baz:1});
</code></pre>
<p>Note that null is a valid value for overwriting, but undefined isnt. You might be able to make use of this.</p>
<pre><code>var a = {foo: a, bar: a};
var b = {foo: null, bar: undefined};
jQuery.extend(a,b);
console.log(A: Foo= + a.foo +  Bar= + a.bar);
</code></pre>
<p>Results in:</p>
<pre><code>A: Foo=null Bar=a
</code></pre>
<h1>Single Parameter</h1>
<p>If you pass just one object to <code>jQuery.extend()</code>, then jQuery assumes that the <code>jQuery</code> object <em>itself</em> is the first parameter (ie: the one to be modified), and your object is the second (ie: the one to add to the first). So:</p>
<pre><code>console.log( Before:  + jQuery.foo );
jQuery.extend({foo:1});
console.log( After:  + jQuery.foo );
</code></pre>
<p>Results in:</p>
<pre><code>Before: undefined
After: 1
</code></pre>","<p>It <strong>merges the content of one object to another</strong>. If we pass two  objects, <strong>second object properties are added to the first object / first parameter</strong></p>
<pre><code>Ex: $.extend(object1, object2);
</code></pre>
<p>Now <strong>object1 contains properties of object2</strong></p>
<p>If we want to <strong>merge two objects</strong>, then we need to pass empty object in the first parameter</p>
<pre><code>Ex: var newObject = $.extend({}, object1, object2);
</code></pre>
<p>Now <strong>newObject contains both properties of object1 and object2</strong>.</p>","<p>From jQuery Documentation</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28957291/avro-vs-parquet,hadoop - Avro vs. Parquet,"<p>If you havent already decided, Id go ahead and write Avro schemas for your data. Once thats done, choosing between Avro container files and Parquet files is about as simple as swapping out e.g.,</p>

<p>for</p>
<pre><code>job.setOutputFormatClass(AvroParquetOutputFormat.class);
AvroParquetOutputFormat.setSchema(job, MyAvroType.getClassSchema());
</code></pre>
<p>The Parquet format does seem to be a bit more computationally intensive on the write side--e.g., requiring RAM for buffering and CPU for ordering the data etc. but it should reduce I/O, storage and transfer costs as well as make for efficient reads especially with SQL-like (e.g., Hive or SparkSQL) queries that only address a portion of the columns.</p>
<p>In one project, I ended up reverting from Parquet to Avro containers because the schema was too extensive and nested (being derived from some fairly hierarchical object-oriented classes) and resulted in 1000s of Parquet columns. In turn, our row groups were really wide and shallow which meant that it took forever before we could process a small number of rows in the last column of each group.</p>
<p>I havent had much chance to use Parquet for more normalized/sane data yet but I understand that if used well, it allows for significant performance improvements.</p>","<p>Avro is a Row based format. If you want to retrieve the data as a whole you can use Avro</p>

<p><a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5cw9x18z.aspx rel=noreferrer>RemoveAt(int index)</a> can be used if you know the index of the item. For example:</p>
<pre><code>resultlist.RemoveAt(1);
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can use <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cd666k3e.aspx rel=noreferrer>Remove(T item)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>var itemToRemove = resultlist.Single(r =&gt; r.Id == 2);
resultList.Remove(itemToRemove);
</code></pre>
<p>When you are not sure the item really exists you can use <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549274.aspx rel=noreferrer>SingleOrDefault</a>. <code>SingleOrDefault</code> will return <code>null</code> if there is no item (<code>Single</code> will throw an exception when it cant find the item). Both will throw when there is a duplicate value (two items with the same <code>id</code>).</p>
<pre><code>var itemToRemove = resultlist.SingleOrDefault(r =&gt; r.Id == 2);
if (itemToRemove != null)
    resultList.Remove(itemToRemove);
</code></pre>","<p><strong>Short answer:</strong><br/>
<strong><sub>Remove (from list <code>results</code>)</sub></strong></p>
<p><code>results.RemoveAll(r =&gt; r.ID == 2);</code> will remove the item with <strong>ID 2</strong> in <code>results</code> (in place).</p>
<p><strong><sub>Filter (without removing from original list <code>results</code>):</sub></strong></p>
<p><code>var filtered = result.Where(f =&gt; f.ID != 2);</code> returns all items except the one with <strong>ID 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Detailed answer:</strong></p>
<p>I think <strong><code>.RemoveAll()</code></strong> is very flexible, because you can have a list of item IDs which you want to remove - please regard the following example.</p>
<p>If you have:</p>
<pre><code>class myClass {
    public int ID; public string FirstName; public string LastName;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and assigned some values to <code>results</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>var results = new List&lt;myClass&gt; {
    new myClass { ID=1, FirstName=Bill, LastName=Smith },   // results[0]
    new myClass { ID=2, FirstName=John, LastName=Wilson },  // results[1]
    new myClass { ID=3, FirstName=Doug, LastName=Berg },    // results[2]
    new myClass { ID=4, FirstName=Bill, LastName=Wilson }   // results[3]
};
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can define a list of IDs to remove:</p>
<pre><code>var removeList = new List&lt;int&gt;() { 2, 3 };
</code></pre>
<p>And simply use this to remove them:</p>
<pre><code>results.RemoveAll(r =&gt; removeList.Any(a =&gt; a==r.ID));
</code></pre>
<p>It will <strong>remove the items 2 and 3</strong> and keep the items 1 and 4 - as specified by the <code>removeList</code>. <strong>Note</strong> that this happens in place, so there is no additional assigment required.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also use it on single items like:</p>
<pre><code>results.RemoveAll(r =&gt; r.ID==4);
</code></pre>
<p>where it will remove Bill with ID 4 in our example.</p>
<p>A last thing to mention is that lists have an indexer, that is, they can also be accessed like a dynamic array, i.e. <code>results[3]</code> will give you the 4th element in the results list (because the first element has the index 0, the 2nd has index 1 etc).</p>
<p>So if you want to remove all entries where the first name is the same as in the 4th element of the results list, you can simply do it this way:</p>
<pre><code>results.RemoveAll(r =&gt; results[3].FirstName == r.FirstName);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that afterwards, only John and Doug will remain in the list, Bill is removed (the first and last element in the example). Important is that the list will shrink automatically, so it has only 2 elements left - and hence the largest allowed index after executing RemoveAll in this example is 1 <br/>(which is <code>results.Count() - 1</code>).</p>
<p>Some Trivia: You can use this knowledge and create a local function</p>
<pre><code>void myRemove()  { var last = results.Count() - 1; 
                   results.RemoveAll(r =&gt; results[last].FirstName == r.FirstName); }
</code></pre>
<p>What do you think will happen, if you call this function twice?
Like</p>
<pre><code>myRemove(); myRemove(); 
</code></pre>
<p>The first call will remove Bill at the first and last position, the second call will remove Doug and only John Wilson remains in the list.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8 rel=noreferrer>C# Version 8</a>, you can as well write <code>results[^1]</code> instead of <code>var last = results.Count() - 1;</code> and  <code>results[last]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>void myRemove()  =&gt;  results.RemoveAll(r =&gt; results[^1].FirstName == r.FirstName); 
</code></pre>
<p>So you would not need the local variable <code>last</code> anymore (see <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8#indices-and-ranges rel=noreferrer>indices and ranges</a>). Furthermore, since it is a one-liner, you dont require the curly braces and can use <code>=&gt;</code> instead.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51983011/when-should-i-use-a-futurebuilder,dart - When should I use a FutureBuilder?,"<p><code>FutureBuilder</code> removes boilerplate code.</p>
<p>Lets say you want to fetch some data from the backend on page launch and show a loader until data comes.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks for ListBuilder:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have two state variables, <code>dataFromBackend</code> and <code>isLoadingFlag</code></li>
<li>On launch, set <code>isLoadingFlag = true</code>, and based on this, show <code>loader</code>.</li>
<li>Once data arrives, set data with what you get from backend and set <code>isLoadingFlag = false</code> (inside <code>setState</code> obviously)</li>
<li>We need to have a <code>if-else</code> in widget creation. If <code>isLoadingFlag</code> is <code>true</code>, show the <code>loader</code> else show the <code>data</code>. On failure, show error message.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tasks for FutureBuilder:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give the async task in <code>future</code> of Future Builder</li>
<li>Based on <code>connectionState</code>, show message (<code>loading</code>, <code>active(streams)</code>, <code>done</code>)</li>
<li>Based on <code>data(snapshot.hasError)</code>, show view</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros of FutureBuilder</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does not use the two state variables and <code>setState</code></li>
<li>Reactive programming (<code>FutureBuilder</code> will take care of updating the view on data arrival)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>FutureBuilder&lt;String&gt;(
    future: _fetchNetworkCall, // async work
    builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot&lt;String&gt; snapshot) {
       switch (snapshot.connectionState) {
         case ConnectionState.waiting: return Text(Loading....);
         default:
           if (snapshot.hasError)
              return Text(Error: ${snapshot.error});
           else
          return Text(Result: ${snapshot.data});
        }
      },
    )
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Performance impact:</strong></p>
<p>I just looked into the <code>FutureBuilder</code> code to understand the <strong>performance</strong> impact of using this.</p>
<ul>
<li>FutureBuilder is just a <code>StatefulWidget</code> whose <code>state</code> variable is <code>_snapshot</code></li>
<li>Initial state is <code>_snapshot = AsyncSnapshot&lt;T&gt;.withData(ConnectionState.none, widget.initialData);</code></li>
<li>It is subscribing to <code>future</code> which we send via the constructor and update the <code>state</code> based on that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>widget.future.then&lt;void&gt;((T data) {
    if (_activeCallbackIdentity == callbackIdentity) {
      setState(() {
        _snapshot = AsyncSnapshot&lt;T&gt;.withData(ConnectionState.done, data);
      });
    }
}, onError: (Object error) {
  if (_activeCallbackIdentity == callbackIdentity) {
    setState(() {
      _snapshot = AsyncSnapshot&lt;T&gt;.withError(ConnectionState.done, error);
    });
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>So the <code>FutureBuilder</code> is a <strong>wrapper/boilerplate</strong> of what we do typically, hence there <strong>should not be any performance impact</strong>.</p>","<p><strong>FutureBuilder Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you want to  rander widget after async call then use  <strong><code>FutureBuilder()</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>class _DemoState extends State&lt;Demo&gt; {

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return FutureBuilder&lt;String&gt;(
    future: downloadData(), // function where you call your api
    builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot&lt;String&gt; snapshot) {  // AsyncSnapshot&lt;Your object type&gt;
      if( snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting){
          return  Center(child: Text(Please wait its loading...));
      }else{
          if (snapshot.hasError)
            return Center(child: Text(Error: ${snapshot.error}));
          else
            return Center(child: new Text(${snapshot.data}));  // snapshot.data  :- get your object which is pass from your downloadData() function
      }
    },
  );
}
Future&lt;String&gt; downloadData()async{
  //   var response =  await http.get(https://getProjectList);    
  return Future.value(Data download successfully); // return your response
}
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In future builder, it calls the future function to wait for the result, and as soon as it produces the result it calls the builder function where we build the widget.</p>
<p>AsyncSnapshot has 3 state:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>connectionState.none</strong> = In this state future is null <br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>connectionState.waiting</strong> = [future] is not null, but has not yet completed<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>connectionState.done</strong> = [future] is not null, and has completed. If the future completed successfully, the [AsyncSnapshot.data] will be set to the value to which the future completed. If it completed with an error, [AsyncSnapshot.hasError] will be true</li>
</ol>","<p>FutureBuilder is a Widget that will help you to execute some asynchronous function and based on that function’s result your UI will update.</p>
<p>I listed some use cases, why you will use FutureBuilder?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you want to render widget after async task then use it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We can handle loading process by simply using <code>ConnectionState.waiting</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Dont need any custom error controller. Can handle error simply <code>dataSnapshot.error != null</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>As we can handle async task within the builder we do not need any <code>setState(() { _isLoading = false; });</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When we use the FutureBuilder widget we need to check for future state i.e future is resolved or not and so on. There are various State as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>ConnectionState.none:</code>  It means that the future is null and initialData is used as defaultValue.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>ConnectionState.active:</code> It means the future is not null but it is not resolved yet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>ConnectionState.waiting:</code> It means the future is being resolved, and we will get the result soon enough.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>ConnectionState.done:</code> It means that the future has been resolved.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A simple implementation</p>
<p>Here OrdersProvider is a provider class and fetchAndSetOrders() is the method of that provider class.</p>
<pre><code>body: FutureBuilder(
        future: Provider.of&lt;OrdersProvider&gt;(context, listen: false)
            .fetchAndSetOrders(),

          if (dataSnapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
            return Center(

<blockquote>
<p>In user defined base classes, abstract methods should raise this exception when they require derived classes to override the method, or while the class is being developed to indicate that the real implementation still needs to be added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that although the main stated use case this error is the indication of abstract methods that should be implemented on inherited classes, you can use it anyhow youd like, like for indication of a <code>TODO</code> marker.</p>","<p>As <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/44316063/4653485>Uriel says</a>, it is meant for a method in an abstract class that should be implemented in child class, but can be used to indicate a TODO as well.</p>
<p>There is an alternative for the first use case: <a href=https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/abc.html rel=noreferrer>Abstract Base Classes</a>. Those help creating abstract classes.</p>
<p>Heres a Python 3 example:</p>
<pre><code>class C(abc.ABC):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def my_abstract_method(self, ...):
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>When instantiating <code>C</code>, youll get an error because <code>my_abstract_method</code> is abstract. You need to implement it in a child class.</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: Cant instantiate abstract class C with abstract methods my_abstract_method
</code></pre>
<p>Subclass <code>C</code> and implement <code>my_abstract_method</code>.</p>
<pre><code>class D(C):
    def my_abstract_method(self, ...):
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can instantiate <code>D</code>.</p>
<p><code>C.my_abstract_method</code> does not have to be empty. It can be called from <code>D</code> using <code>super()</code>.</p>
<p>An advantage of this over <code>NotImplementedError</code> is that you get an explicit <code>Exception</code> at instantiation time, not at method call time.</p>","<p>Consider if instead it was:</p>

    def cleanTileAtPosition(self, pos):
        pass

    def isTileCleaned(self, m, n):
        pass

<p>and you subclass and forget to tell it how to <code>isTileCleaned()</code> or, perhaps more likely, typo it as <code>isTileCLeaned()</code>. Then in your code, youll get a <code>None</code> when you call it. </p>
<ul>
<li>Will you get the overridden function you wanted? Definitely not.</li>
<li>Is <code>None</code> valid output? Who knows.  </li>
<li>Is that intended behavior? Almost certainly not. </li>
