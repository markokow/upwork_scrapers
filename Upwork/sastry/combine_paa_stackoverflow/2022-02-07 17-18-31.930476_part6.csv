Check the length of your objects with nrow(). R can auto-replicate objects so that theyre the same length if they differ, which means you might be performing operations on mismatched data.</p>
<p>In this case you have an obvious flaw in that your subtracting aggregated data from raw data. These will definitely be of different lengths. I suggest that you merge them as time series (using the dates), then locf(), then do your subtraction.  Otherwise merge them by truncating the original dates to the same interval as the aggregated series. Just be very careful that you dont drop observations.</p>

<p>When <code>ANSI_NULLS</code> is on (which you should always set on anyway, since the option to not have it on is going to be removed in the future), any comparison operation where (at least) one of the operands is <code>NULL</code> produces the third logic value - <code>UNKNOWN</code> (as opposed to <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>).</p>
<p><code>UNKNOWN</code> values propagate through any combining boolean operators if theyre not already decided (e.g. <code>AND</code> with a <code>FALSE</code> operand or <code>OR</code> with a <code>TRUE</code> operand) or negations (<code>NOT</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>WHERE</code> clause is used to filter the result set produced by the <code>FROM</code> clause, such that the overall value of the <code>WHERE</code> clause must be <code>TRUE</code> for the row to not be filtered out. So, if an <code>UNKNOWN</code> is produced by any comparison, it will cause the row to be filtered out.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55108794/what-is-the-difference-of-pairs-vs-ipairs-in-lua,for loop - What is the difference of pairs() vs. ipairs() in Lua?,"<p><code>pairs()</code> and <code>ipairs()</code> are slightly different.  </p>
<ul>
<li><code>pairs()</code> returns key-value pairs and is mostly used for associative tables. key order is unspecified.  </li>
<li><code>ipairs()</code> returns index-value pairs and is mostly used for numeric tables. Non numeric keys in an array are ignored, while the index order is deterministic (in numeric order).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is illustrated by the following code fragment.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; u={}
&gt; u[1]=a
&gt; u[3]=b
&gt; u[2]=c
&gt; u[4]=d
&gt; u[hello]=world
&gt; for key,value in ipairs(u) do print(key,value) end
1   a
2   c
3   b
4   d
&gt; for key,value in pairs(u) do print(key,value) end
1   a
hello   world
3   b
2   c
4   d
&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>When you create an tables without keys (as in your question), it behaves as a numeric array  and behaviour or pairs and ipairs is identical.</p>
<pre><code>a = {one, two, three}
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to <code>a[1]=one</code> <code>a[2]=two</code> <code>a[3]=three</code>
and <code>pairs()</code> and <code>ipairs()</code> will be identical (except for the ordering that is not guaranteed in <code>pairs()</code>).</p>","<p>There is no <code>array</code>-type in Lua, only <code>table</code>s which might have consecutive elements starting from index 1.</p>
<p>The generic for-loop, in contrast to the numeric for-loop, expects three values:</p>
<ol>
<li>A callable</li>
<li>A context-value it passes on</li>
<li>An initial index-value</li>
</ol>
<p>It calls the callable with context-value and index-value, storing all the returned values in the provided new variables. The first one is additionally saved as the new index-value.</p>
<p>Now some representative examples of callables for the loop:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>ipairs(t)</code> returns a function, the table <code>t</code>, and the starting-point <code>0</code>.<br/>
The function is the moral equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>function ipairs_next(t, i)
    i = i + 1
    var v = t[i]
    if v ~= nil then
        return i, v
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, all numeric entries starting at 1 until the first missing one are shown.</p></li>
<li><p><code>pairs(t)</code> either delegates to <code>t</code>s metatable, specifically to <code>__pairs(t)</code>, or returns the function <code>next</code>, the table <code>t</code>, and the starting-point <code>nil</code>.
<code>next</code> accepts a table and an index, and returns the next index and the associated value, if it exists.</p>
<p>Thus, all elements are shown in some arbitrary order.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no limits to how creative one can be with the function, and that is what vanilla Lua expects.<br/>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32805087/how-is-overflow-detected-in-twos-complement,binary - How is overflow detected in twos complement?,"<p>Lets start with an answer to your title question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is overflow detected in twos complement?</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overflow rule : If two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative) are added, then overflow occurs if and only if the result has the opposite sign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you ask something different on the body of your question after your example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So here the result has fifth left bit <code>10001</code> - is it overflow?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No! there is no overflow here. That fifth bit is the carry/borrow. Carry if you are talking about addition. Borrow if you are talking about subtraction.</p>
<p>Overflow occurs when the number that you trying to represent is out of the range of numbers that can be represented. In your example you are using 4-bits twos complement, that means you can represent any number in the range <code>-8</code> (<code>1000</code>) up to <code>+7</code> (<code>0111</code>). The result of your subtraction <code>2-1</code> is <code>+1</code>, a number that lies within the range of representation.</p>
<p>When we add a negative and a positive operand, the result will always be in the range of representation. Overflows occur when we add two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative) and the result has the opposite sign.</p>
<p>Most of misunderstanding surrounding carry-out and overflow comes from the fact we use the carry-out as one of the parameters to generate overflow flag. They are strongly related but they are not the same thing.</p>
<p>When adding numbers in twos complement, if the carry-out and the carry-on into the most significant bit (sign bit) are different that means an overflow has occurred.</p>
<p>Lets see two negative operands with a positive result:</p>
<pre><code>-8 + (-1) = -9 

 1000  (carry)
  1000 (-8)
+ 1111 (-1)
------
  0111 (+7) OVERFLOW!
</code></pre>
<p>The carry-out is 1 and the carry-on to sign bit (MSB) is 0.</p>
<p>And now, an example of two positive operands with a negative result.</p>
<pre><code>+7 + 1 = +8

 0111  (carry)
  0111 (+7)
+ 0001 (+1)
------
  1000 (-8) OVERFLOW!
</code></pre>
<p>The carry-out is 0 and the carry-on to sign bit (MSB) is 1.</p>","<p>@GabrielOshiros answer is really good. I just want to add a little bit of logic here. When you add 2 and -1 together here,</p>
<pre><code>2 = 0010
1 = 0001 -&gt; -1 = 1111
2 + (-1) -&gt; 0010 + 1111 = 10001
</code></pre>
<p>You should separate the most significant bit in the negative number from the rest of the bits, since in twos complement that bit brings negative value. So if you first add everything else first:</p>
<pre><code>0010 + 0111(leave out the leftmost 1 for now) = 1001
</code></pre>
<p>After this, we can clearly see that the fifth bit in 10001 is caused by adding the 1 we left earlier (in fourth bit) with 1001, yielding a carry in the fifth bit. However, since this 1 should really cancel out with the 1001, leave us with 0001, we can safely ignore the extra bit in 10001 here.</p>
<p>A more in depth reasoning would be considering when we can safely ignore this extra bit and when we cant. As @GabrielOshiro mentioned, when the carry-out from and carry-on into the most significant are different we cannot ignore it. In a carry-out 2 units of negative numbers are lost because theres no space to hold the extra bit, and in a carry-in two units of positive numbers are lost, since what is supposed to be a unit of positive number is considered as a unit of negative instead. Here 1 - (-1) = 2. Therefore, a carry-on and a carry-out will cancel each other. But when only one of them occurs, the result will be incorrect thus we have an overflow.</p>",,2s complement overflow,2s complement overflow,"Two's Complement Overflow Rules. The rules for detecting overflow in a two's complement sum are simple: If the sum of two positive numbers yields a negative result, the sum has overflowed.
