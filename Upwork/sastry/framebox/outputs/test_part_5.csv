Akira Toriyama himself stated it during an interview (stament here ).</p> <h2 id=""how-did-android-17-come-back-in-dragon-ball"">How did Android 17 come back in Dragon Ball super?</h2> <p>How in Dragon Ball Super does Android 17 come back to fight in the multiverse tournament? Android 17 was ressurected in the Cell saga from the wish made by Krillin to Shenron. He was an off-character till the Tournament of Power.</p> <h2 id=""how-did-android-17-become-super-17"">How did Android 17 become Super 17?</h2> <p>“Super No. 17”) is the powerful fusion of Android 17 and Hell Fighter 17; created by the evil scientists Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu. He is the main antagonist of the Super 17 Saga.</p> <div class=""mb-5""><div class=""rll-youtube-player"" data-id=""lGIoGrL5YCg"" data-query="""" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGIoGrL5YCg""></div><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGIoGrL5YCg"" width=""740""></iframe></noscript></div> <h2 id=""why-did-android-17-win"">Why did Android 17 win?</h2> <p>Android 17 won the Tournament of Power for a reason, and it’s a reason many fans will not be able to argue against. When Goku was searching for strong fighters to represent Universe 7 in the Tournament of Power, his search brought him to Android 17 who had changed a lot since his time in Dragon Ball Z.</p> <h2 id=""who-is-stronger-goku-or-golden-frieza"">Who is stronger Goku or golden Frieza?</h2> <p>Jacob Bates, Been watching Dragon Ball since I was young. He is stronger when he has no energy used. But much like his full power form the more he uses it the weaker he is, so Golden Frieza is stronger than blue, but only for a little bit, then blue will be stronger.</p> <h2 id=""is-android-16-the-strongest"">Is Android 16 the strongest?</h2> <p>Android 16 is revealed to be the most powerful of the Red Ribbon Androids, other than Cell. In Dragon Ball Z Kai, Dr. Gero stated that Android 16 himself, can doom the entire planet. Daizenshuu states that Android 16 is even stronger than Android 13.</p> <h2 id=""who-is-stronger-gohan-or-vegeta"">Who is stronger Gohan or Vegeta?</h2> <p>Ultimate Gohan. When Goku and Vegeta fought during the Majin Buu arc, they were about evenly matched in SSJ2 form. This means that, as a SSJ3, Goku would be 4x stronger than Majin Vegeta. Later, when Super Buu emerges, Gotenks as a SSJ3 (who is about 8x stronger than SSJ3 Goku) was only a little bit stronger than him.</p> <h2 id=""is-android-18-stronger-than-piccolo"">Is Android 18 stronger than Piccolo?</h2> <p>So it’s safe to say that Piccolo is the most appropriate person to be on Beerus’ team. At first, Android 17 and 18 were much stronger than Piccolo. By the end of the Cell Saga, Piccolo has trained in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and become much stronger than the Androids.</p> <div class=""mb-5""><div class=""rll-youtube-player"" data-id=""XuAG9aOtnMU"" data-query="""" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuAG9aOtnMU""></div><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuAG9aOtnMU"" width=""740""></iframe></noscript></div> <h2 id=""is-17-and-18-a-human"">Is 17 and 18 a human?</h2> <p>Lazuli or ‘android 18’ is not an android, she and her twin brother Lapis (’17′) are cyborgs, they were not artificial constructs like 19, 16, 15, 14, and 13 were, and that is why Krillin and Lazuli have a child together.</p> <h2 id=""who-made-android-17-and-18"">Who made Android 17 and 18?</h2> <p>Background. Android 17 was originally a human named Lapis, and the younger of he and his twin sister Lazuli. The twins were notorious delinquents, who Dr. Gero would meet by chance while looking for fresh material for his experiments. He then kidnapped them and restructured them into Android 17 and Android 18.</p> <h2 id=""did-android-17-die-super"">Did Android 17 die super?</h2> <p>With a final bow, Android 17 self-destructed to divert an attack from Jiren that would have killed Goku and Vegeta. The selfless act was touching, but his death has bigger ramifications than you may realize. By the end of Dragon Ball Z, Android 17 is alive as fans already know.</p> <h2 id=""is-cell-an-android"">Is cell an android?</h2> <p>Cell is Dr. Gero’s only “bio-android”; a synthetic man completely made of living parts. He was made using the collected cells of the Z Fighters and Frieza. Flight – Cell has the ability to fly through use of his Ki like other characters in Dragon Ball Z.</p> <h2 id=""does-android-16-come-back-to-life"">Does Android 16 come back to life?</h2> <p>No because after the buu saga every thing was restore back to normal &amp; android 16 was killed by cell and after cell saga when every living being was restored back to normal Android 16 was not brought back and also he is not human so he can not be born it can be made though.</p> <div class=""mb-5""><div class=""rll-youtube-player"" data-id=""y0bd1TxMo2w"" data-query="""" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0bd1TxMo2w""></div><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0bd1TxMo2w"" width=""740""></iframe></noscript></div> <h2 id=""how-did-dr-gero-become-an-android"">How did Dr Gero become an android?</h2> <p>To become immortal, Dr. Gero ordered Android 19 to turn him into an android, thus becoming Android 20.

When you say Trunks, I’m assuming you are talking about Future Trunks. Another point to see is that present Trunks (kid version) is stronger than Frieza when Goku first fought him. His Super Saiyan form is already equal to if not stronger than Goku’s power against Frieza in that fight, so he IS super strong.</p> <div class=""mb-5""><div class=""rll-youtube-player"" data-id=""NGXCYnBzN3U"" data-query="""" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGXCYnBzN3U""></div><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGXCYnBzN3U"" width=""740""></iframe></noscript></div> <h2 id=""is-future-trunks-stronger-than-vegeta"">Is Future Trunks stronger than Vegeta?</h2> <p>Vegeta says that Goku is the strongest one of them, but this was before he knew about Gohan.
