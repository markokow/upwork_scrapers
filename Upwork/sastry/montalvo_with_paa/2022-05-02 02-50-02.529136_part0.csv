<p>Shortbread cookies have the highest ratio of butter to flour.  While butter cookies still have a high proportion of butter, the amount of flour and sugar is increased, which means they will hold their shape better than a shortbread.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between sugar cookies and butter cookies is that sugar cookies are often rolled thin and cut out using cookie cutters. While butter cookies will hold their shape while baking, the dough is much softer and for best results should be piped onto a baking sheet and then baked.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_cookie_butter_healthier_than_peanut_butter""></span>Is cookie butter healthier than peanut butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>There are only 90 calories in one serving (a tablespoon), six grams of fat, and only five grams of sugar. The only real downside is that unlike peanut butter, cookie butter offers virtually no protein. Chances are you aren’t eating cookie butter for the protein though, so we’ll let that slide.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_are_my_butter_cookies_hard""></span>Why are my butter cookies hard?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The most common reason that cookies are tough is that the cookie dough was mixed too much. When flour is mixed into the dough, gluten begins to form. Gluten helps hold baked goods together, but too much gluten can lead to tough cookies.  You can also let the dough rest before baking to let the gluten relax a bit.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_butter_cookies_taste_so_good""></span>Why do butter cookies taste so good?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Butter cookies are very similar to shortbread, with the main variation being an increase in sugar. In addition to making them taste awesome, the higher ratio of sugar to butter means a butter cookie is cookie-cutter-ready and bakes beautifully without any tendency to crumble.</p>

<p>Dough that has been overworked is a surefire way to get tough shortbread – something no shortbread should ever be.  Melted butter will result in tough dough as well, as the flour will absorb it too quickly, and unevenly.</p>

<p>They’re both delicious cookies, but different. Sugar cookies are lighter, while shortbread is dense. Shortbread is more rustic, while sugar cookies work best for cutting and decorating. Sugar cookies will have a leavening (baking powder or soda) while shortbread has a short and simple ingredient list.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_you_melt_butter_for_cookies""></span>Should you melt butter for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Many cookie recipes use room temperature butter and the directions will have you cream it together with sugar, but if you don’t want to leave the butter on the counter and wait for your baked goods, just melt the butter!  According to the Spruce Eats, using melted butter to bake cookies makes them deliciously dense.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_butter_be_cold_for_cookies""></span>Should butter be cold for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Use it in: cakes and soft cookies. For best results: make sure butter is fully at room temperature. If you’re in a hurry, cut butter into tiny pieces and it will quickly soften. Cold butter is ideal for baked goods that should be crisp.</p>

<p>Cookie butter, believe it or not, is exactly what it sounds like — a creamy spread made from European spice cookies called speculoos cookies. This ice cream starts as an attempt to bring that sweet, rich flavor to the frozen world, blending delicious vanilla ice cream with generous swirls of actual cookie butter.</p>

<p>Butter is the dairy product made from churning milk or cream. The churning process separates the butterfat (the solids) from the buttermilk (the liquid). The butter we most often buy is made from cow’s milk, although other varieties — made from the milk of sheep, goat, yak, or buffalo — are also available.</p>

<p>Homemade butter’s shelf life depends on how thoroughly you extract the buttermilk. If a substantial amount of buttermilk remains, it will sour within a week, otherwise homemade butter can keep for up to 2-3 weeks in the fridge.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_make_salted_butter""></span>Can I make salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Regular butter contains some salt, and most recipes take this into account. But if you only have unsalted butter when the recipe calls for regular butter, you can add a ¼ teaspoon of salt for every stick or ½ cup of Challenge Unsalted Butter required.</p>

<p>If you are worried about wasting your fresh buttermilk, you can use it to make ice cream, biscuits and casseroles, among many other tasty dishes. While homemade butter is cheaper than store bought, buttermilk from the store is cheaper than homemade.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_make_butter_with_blender""></span>Can you make butter with blender?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Making Butter in the Blender A blender or food processor (you can use either) makes short work of transforming cream into butter and buttermilk.  Once the cream has separated, pour off the buttermilk (save it for pancakes!), and “wash” the butter a few times by blending it with some fresh water.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_margarine_the_same_as_butter""></span>Is margarine the same as butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Butter is a dairy product made by churning cream. Conversely, margarine is a product designed to imitate butter. While butter is mainly composed of dairy fat, margarine is typically produced from vegetable oils.</p>

<p>Unsalted Butter or “Sweet Cream Butter” (Real) It’s probably your go-to, and for good reason. Containing around 80% milkfat, this butter is the most versatile in cooking from baking to sautéing.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_margarine_be_used_as_butter""></span>Can margarine be used as butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Tub margarine can easily be substituted for butter at the table for spreading, and some people use it on the stovetop for cooking, though we typically favour using oil over margarine in cases like this.  Using margarine instead of butter in a recipe tested with butter may yield unexpected results.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_made_butter""></span>What made butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of churned cream.  Most frequently made from cow’s milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_to_do_if_butter_is_not_coming""></span>What to do if butter is not coming?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>What should I do if the butter is not coming out of cream?  Add ½ cup of ice cold water or 5 to 6 ice cubes to the cream. If the butter has not separated after using ice water or ice cubes, then place the bowl in the fridge for an hour. Sometimes, melted butter will be dispersed in the cream and won’t separate. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_use_homemade_butter_for_baking""></span>Can you use homemade butter for baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Yes, absolutely! Just make sure you use good, fresh cream without any additives, and that it’s well strained so that it has a liquid content of around 10%. Keep it well wrapped and refrigerated if you don’t plan on using it immediately or are making a big batch. A tip: add vanilla extract to your homemade butter!.</p>

<p>Tips for the Moist Vanilla Cupcakes  Use room temperature butter for the batter and frosting. Using room temperature butter is crucial to making fluffy cupcakes. Fill cupcake liners only 2/3 of the way full. Use high-quality vanilla extract. Sift the dry ingredients. </p>

<p>When you cream the two, ideally the sugar granules poke tiny bubbles in the butter to capture air, which ultimately creates a much lighter and fluffier cupcake. The butter should be softened to room temp, and definitely not full liquid (easy on the microwaving) or block-style straight out of the ice box.</p>

<p>This may seem like a lot of information, but there are really only a few key points to take from this:  Use the all-in-one method. Always use room temperature eggs and butter. Don’t use too much raising agent. Avoid overmixing the batter if you can. Don’t open the oven before the cupcakes are done. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Which_butter_is_good_for_baking_cake""></span>Which butter is good for baking cake?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>For cakes, cookies, and pastries, butter (unsalted, that is) provides richer flavor. (It begins as cream, after all, and margarine is made from vegetable oil.) Butter’s high fat content is also what gives baked goods their texture.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_unsalted_butter_for_cakes""></span>Can I use unsalted butter for cakes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When you use unsalted butter in a recipe, you can control the exact amount of salt in your baked good.  It would take quite a lot of salted butter to really produce a huge taste difference in baked goods, but it’s still good to be able to fully control the amount of salt. 2. Unsalted butter is fresher.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Whats_the_secret_to_a_moist_cake""></span>What’s the secret to a moist cake?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>I promise you SOFT &amp; MOIST cakes!  Use Cake Flour. Reach for cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. Add Sour Cream. Room Temperature Butter / Don’t Over-Cream. Add a Touch of Baking Powder or Baking Soda. Add Oil. Don’t Over-Mix. Don’t Over-Bake. Brush With Simple Syrup/Other Liquid. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Which_ingredient_makes_the_cake_soft""></span>Which ingredient makes the cake soft?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Cake flour, which is more finely ground and contains less protein than its all-purpose counterpart, is a major contributor to how soft and the overall weight of a cake. Since cake flour has less protein, less gluten is formed. Without all of that gluten, the cake becomes less dense, airy, and smooth.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_butter_or_oil_make_a_cake_more_moist""></span>Does butter or oil make a cake more moist?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Vegetable oil contributes moistness far more reliably, a result of the fact that oil remains liquid at room temperature while butter solidifies. Liquid contributes to the sensation of moistness, and therefore cakes made with oil often present as moister than their butter-based counterparts.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_you_melt_butter_for_cakes""></span>Should you melt butter for cakes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If the butter is too cold, the sugar can’t penetrate the butter and air pockets are unable to form. This could result in clumpy batter or uneven bakes. The same goes for butter that is too warm. Melted or liquid butter will thin out your batter, giving you ultra-flat cookies or cakes that are dense and uneven.</p>

<p>It can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour for refrigerated butter to soften to room temperature. Speed things up by cutting the butter into 1-inch cubes: Take a stick of butter and halve it lengthwise.</p>

<p>Place softened butter and sugar into large mixing bowl. Mix, using hand mixer or stand mixer on medium speed 1-2 minutes, or until butter mixture is pale yellow, light and fluffy. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl once or twice while mixing.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_makes_a_cupcake_light_and_fluffy""></span>What makes a cupcake light and fluffy?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The gluten and fat molecules in the batter are what helps the cupcake set and maintain its fluffy, light structure – give those molecules awhile (at least ⅔ of the total baking time) to set and stiffen up before you introduce any cold air to the atmosphere by sticking your nose in to check on things.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_best_temperature_to_bake_cupcakes_at""></span>What is the best temperature to bake cupcakes at?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Most cupcakes bake well between 325°F and 375°F. Conveniently, these are the same temperatures that cakes are usually baked at too. You can probably use the temperature the cake recipe calls for, or you can adjust it if you’re looking for specific results.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_makes_the_perfect_cupcake""></span>What makes the perfect cupcake?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The trick to perfect consistently shaped cupcakes is an ice cream scoop. We use a 3 tablespoon scoop which fills the cupcake liners 2/3 full which is the perfect amount of batter for each cupcake. Too little batter (liners 1/2 filled) and the cupcakes won’t rise over the edge of the cupcake liner.</p>
