<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Are_turmeric_and_cumin_the_same_thing""></span>Are turmeric and cumin the same thing?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Turmeric is a root that comes from a flowering plant that is part of the ginger family, known as the Curcuma longa. The spice contains curcumin which is occasionally mixed up with the word cumin. However, cumin seed is a completely unrelated spice; it comes from the Cuminum cyminum plant.</p>

<p>Most people in America associate curry with the fragrant yellow powder used to spice up chicken salad, deviled eggs and other dishes.

<p>Turmeric should not be consumed raw (unless it’s in a smoothie) because it simply won’t taste so great, and, like I said, cooking it with oil and pepper enhances its benefits. To reap its full benefits in a smoothie, add a couple of black peppercorns into your blender.</p>
