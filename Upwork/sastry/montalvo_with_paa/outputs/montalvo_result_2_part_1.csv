<p>???? A New England Clam Chowder is creamy and thick like you’re sipping a gravy with tender chunks of potatoes that almost feel like it melts in your month. You’ll also love the contrasting flavor of the saltiness and smokiness of the bacon and the fading bitterness of fresh “oceany” clams.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_clam_chowder_served_on_Fridays""></span>Why is clam chowder served on Fridays?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The idea of having seafood on a Friday goes back to when Catholic Christians were forbidden to have any meat on a Friday, any time of the year. Today, the abstinence from meat on Fridays only applies during Lent, but some use Fridays as an occasion to enjoy fish as an alternative to land-based meats once a week.</p>

Finally, it’s always served hot.</p>

<p>In Japan, Shiso is used for many purposes: battered and served as tempura; used in pickles such as Umeboshi; the seeds can be used as a garnish; leaves can be wrapped around sushi; dried leaves can be powdered and used as a garnish; oil can be distilled from the dried leaves (the oil is used in Korean cooking);.</p>

<p>In addition to its traditional uses, we liked shiso tossed into salads as we would herbs such as mint or basil. However, larger leaves can be tough, so make sure to tear or shred them first. Shiso can also be used in cooked applications, such as fried rice or ramen, or fried whole and used as a garnish.</p>

<p>SHISO, an herb long used in Japanese cooking, is starting to show up in restaurants of all kinds whose chefs are captivated by its strong flavor.

<p>Our chicken isn’t made the fast way or the easy way.  Inspect. Each fresh batch of the world’s best chicken starts with our cooks inspecting each individual piece. Season.

<p>All KFC restaurants in the UK use high oleic rapeseed oil. Prior to this, the chain used palm oil as a cost-effective method of cooking its chicken, but made the switch to a more environmentally friendly alternative.</p>

<p>In 1983, William Poundstone conducted laboratory research into the coating mix, as described in his book Big Secrets, and claimed that a sample he examined contained only flour, salt, monosodium glutamate and black pepper. KFC maintains that it still adheres to Sanders’ original 1940 recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_KFC_chicken_baked_or_fried""></span>Is KFC chicken baked or fried?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>At Kentucky Fried Chicken, they “hold” the chicken in an oven set to 175 degrees for about 20 minutes, according to a former employee. This allows the chicken to finish cooking while keeping it warm and the skin crunchy.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_KFC_Boil_chicken_before_frying""></span>Do KFC Boil chicken before frying?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>No, KFC does not boil their chicken before frying it. Here is what really happens: Before coating the chicken in the breading, the meat is dipped in cold water (or brine water). Doing so helps the flour stick to the chicken better, so you get a more dense breading after it fries.</p>

<p>She reveals that the finger-licking dressing is made using the leftover juices and chicken scraps found at the bottom of the chicken fryers, a substance she calls “crackling”. Walker explains that the gravy comprises two scoops of crackling mixed with 3.5 litres of water.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_KFC_chicken_so_small""></span>Why is KFC chicken so small?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Back in “The Day”, the chicken breasts were cut differently at KFC so you would get three pieces, instead of two. One competitor made fun of that in a commercial when a woman asks “Chicken don’t have three breasts, do they?” In response, KFC quit cutting the breasts that way and they are now a full size piece.</p>

<p>Originally, part of the secret was to cook chicken parts that where cut in similar size pieces. Some old timers will swear that “KFC” chicken does not taste the same as the “Kentucky Fried Chicken” served decades ago. The company states they still use the “eleven herbs and spices”.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_KFC_chicken_so_moist""></span>Why is KFC chicken so moist?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The chicken is amazingly moist — thanks to a special device. The pressure fryer not only lets KFC cook chicken faster and with less oil, but it also locks in moisture. Witherly theorizes that it may also drive some of that salt and MSG into the meat, making it that much more delicious.</p>
