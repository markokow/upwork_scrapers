https://stackoverflow.com/questions/948135/how-to-write-a-switch-statement-in-ruby,How to write a switch statement in Ruby,"<p>Ruby uses the <a href=http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_expressions.html#S5 rel=noreferrer><code>case</code> expression</a> instead.</p>
<pre><code>case x
when 1..5
  It's between 1 and 5
when 6
  It's 6
when foo, bar
  It's either foo or bar
when String
  You passed a string
else
  You gave me #{x} -- I have no idea what to do with that.
end
</code></pre>
<p>Ruby compares the object in the <code>when</code> clause with the object in the <code>case</code> clause using the <code>===</code> operator. For example, <code>1..5 === x</code>, and not <code>x === 1..5</code>. </p>
<p>This allows for sophisticated <code>when</code> clauses as seen above. Ranges, classes and all sorts of things can be tested for rather than just equality.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>switch</code> statements in many other languages, Ruby’s <code>case</code> does not have <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement#Fallthrough rel=noreferrer>fall-through</a>, so there is no need to end each <code>when</code> with a <code>break</code>. You can also specify multiple matches in a single <code>when</code> clause like <code>when foo, bar</code>.</p>","<p><code>case...when</code> behaves a bit unexpectedly when handling classes. This is due to the fact that it uses the <code>===</code> operator.</p>
<p>That operator works as expected with literals, but not with classes:</p>
<pre><code>1 === 1           # =&gt; true
Fixnum === Fixnum # =&gt; false
</code></pre>
<p>This means that if you want to do a <code>case ... when</code> over an object's class, this will not work:</p>
<pre><code>obj = 'hello'
case obj.class
when String
  print('It is a string')
when Fixnum
  print('It is a number')
else
  print('It is not a string or number')
end
</code></pre>
<p>Will print It is not a string or number.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is easily solved. The <code>===</code> operator has been defined so that it returns <code>true</code> if you use it with a class and supply an instance of that class as the second operand:</p>
<pre><code>Fixnum === 1 # =&gt; true
</code></pre>
<p>In short, the code above can be fixed by removing the <code>.class</code> from <code>case obj.class</code>:</p>
<pre><code>obj = 'hello'
case obj  # was case obj.class
when String
  print('It is a string')
when Fixnum
  print('It is a number')
else
  print('It is not a string or number')

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36577020/php-failed-to-open-stream-no-such-file-or-directory,require - PHP - Failed to open stream : No such file or directory,"<p>There are many reasons why one might run into this error and thus a good checklist of what to check first helps considerably.</p>
<p>Let's consider that we are troubleshooting the following line:</p>
<pre><code>require /path/to/file
</code></pre>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Checklist</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>1. Check the file path for typos</h2>
<ul>
<li>either check manually (by visually checking the path)</li>
<li><p>or move whatever is called by <code>require*</code> or <code>include*</code> to its own variable, echo it, copy it, and try accessing it from a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$path = /path/to/file;

echo Path : $path;

require $path;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;file path pasted&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>2. Check that the file path is correct regarding relative vs absolute path considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>if it is starting by a forward slash / then it is not referring to the root of your website's folder (the document root), but to the root of your server.

<ul>
<li>for example, your website's directory might be <code>/users/tony/htdocs</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>if it is not starting by a forward slash then it is either relying on the include path (see below) or the path is relative. If it is relative, then PHP will calculate relatively to the path of the <a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.getcwd.php rel=noreferrer>current working directory</a>.

<ul>
<li>thus, not relative to the path of your web site's root, or to the file where you are typing</li>
<li>for that reason, always use absolute file paths</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Best practices :</p>
<p>In order to make your script robust in case you move things around, while still generating an absolute path at runtime, you have 2 options :</p>
<ol>
<li>use <code>require __DIR__ . /relative/path/from/current/file</code>. The <a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php rel=noreferrer><code>__DIR__</code> magic constant</a> returns the directory of the current file.</li>
<li><p>define a <code>SITE_ROOT</code> constant yourself :</p>
<ul>
<li>at the root of your web site's directory, create a file, e.g. <code>config.php</code></li>
<li><p>in <code>config.php</code>, write</p>
<pre><code>define('SITE_ROOT', __DIR__);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>in every file where you want to reference the site root folder, include <code>config.php</code>, and then use the <code>SITE_ROOT</code> constant wherever you like :</p>
<pre><code>require_once __DIR__./../config.php;
...
require_once SITE_ROOT./other/file.php;
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These 2 practices also make your application more portable because it does not rely on ini settings like the include path.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>3. Check your include path</h2>
<p>Another way to include files, neither relatively nor purely absolutely, is to rely on the <a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path rel=noreferrer>include path</a>. This is often the case for libraries or frameworks such as the Zend framework.</p>
<p>Such an inclusion will look like this :</p>
<pre><code>include Zend/Mail/Protocol/Imap.php
</code></pre>
<p>In that case, you will want to make sure that the folder where Zend is, is part of the include path.</p>
<p>You can check the include path with :</p>
<pre><code>echo get_include_path();
</code></pre>
<p>You can add a folder to it with :</p>
<pre><code>set_include_path(get_include_path().:./path/to/new/folder);
</code></pre>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>4. Check that your server has access to that file</h2>
<p>It might be that all together, the user running the server process (Apache or PHP) simply doesn't have permission to read from or write to that file.</p>
<p>To check under what user the server is running you can use <a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.posix-getpwuid.php rel=noreferrer>posix_getpwuid</a> :</p>
<pre><code>$user = posix_getpwuid(posix_geteuid());

var_dump($user);
</code></pre>
<p>To find out the permissions on the file, type the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>ls -l &lt;path/to/file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and look at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Symbolic_notation rel=noreferrer>permission symbolic notation</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>5. Check PHP settings</h2>
<p>If none of the above worked, then the issue is probably that some PHP settings forbid it to access that file.</p>
<p>Three settings could be relevant :</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.open-basedir rel=noreferrer>open_basedir</a>
<ul>
<li>If this is set PHP won't be able to access any file outside of the specified directory (not even through a symbolic link).</li>
<li>However, the default behavior is for it not to be set in which case there is no restriction</li>
<li>This can be checked by either calling <a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php rel=noreferrer><code>phpinfo()</code></a> or by using <code>ini_get(open_basedir)</code></li>
<li>You can change the setting either by editing your php.ini file or your httpd.conf file</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/features.safe-mode.php rel=noreferrer>safe mode</a>
<ul>
<li>if this is turned on restrictions might apply. However, this has been removed in PHP 5.4. If you are still on a version that supports safe mode upgrade to a PHP version that is <a href=http://php.net/eol.php rel=noreferrer>still being supported</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php rel=noreferrer>allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include</a>
<ul>
<li>this applies only to including or opening files through a network process such as http:// not when trying to include files on the local file system</li>
<li>this can be checked with <code>ini_get(allow_url_include)</code> and set with <code>ini_set(allow_url_include, 1)</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Corner cases</h1>
<p>If none of the above enabled to diagnose the problem, here are some special situations that could happen :</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>1. The inclusion of library relying on the include path</h2>
<p>It can happen that you include a library, for example, the Zend framework, using a relative or absolute path. For example :</p>
<pre><code>require /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/Mail/Protocol/Imap.php
</code></pre>
<p>But then you still get the same kind of error.</p>
<p>This could happen because the file that you have (successfully) included, has itself an include statement for another file, and that second include statement assumes that you have added the path of that library to the include path.</p>
<p>For example, the Zend framework file mentioned before could have the following include :</p>
<pre><code>include Zend/Mail/Protocol/Exception.php 
</code></pre>
<p>which is neither an inclusion by relative path, nor by absolute path. It is assuming that the Zend framework directory has been added to the include path.</p>
<p>In such a case, the only practical solution is to add the directory to your include path.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>2. SELinux</h2>
<p>If you are running Security-Enhanced Linux, then it might be the reason for the problem, by denying access to the file from the server.</p>
<p><strong>To check whether SELinux is enabled</strong> on your system, run the <code>sestatus</code> command in a terminal. If the command does not exist, then SELinux is not on your system. If it does exist, then it should tell you whether it is enforced or not.</p>
<p><strong>To check whether SELinux policies are the reason</strong> for the problem, you can try turning it off temporarily. However be CAREFUL, since this will disable protection entirely. Do not do this on your production server.</p>
<pre><code>setenforce 0
</code></pre>
<p>If you no longer have the problem with SELinux turned off, then this is the root cause.</p>
<p><strong>To solve it</strong>, you will have to configure SELinux accordingly.</p>
<p>The following context types will be necessary :</p>
<ul>
<li><code>httpd_sys_content_t</code> for files that you want your server to be able to read</li>
<li><code>httpd_sys_rw_content_t</code> for files on which you want read and write access</li>
<li><code>httpd_log_t</code> for log files</li>
<li><code>httpd_cache_t</code> for the cache directory</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to assign the <code>httpd_sys_content_t</code> context type to your website root directory, run :</p>
<pre><code>semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/root(/.*)?
restorecon -Rv /path/to/root
</code></pre>
<p>If your file is in a home directory, you will also need to turn on the <code>httpd_enable_homedirs</code> boolean :</p>
<pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs 1
</code></pre>
<p>In any case, there could be a variety of reasons why SELinux would deny access to a file, depending on your policies. So you will need to enquire into that. <a href=http://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/linux/web-servers-linux/configuring-selinux-policies-for-apache-web-servers/ rel=noreferrer>Here</a> is a tutorial specifically on configuring SELinux for a web server.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>3. Symfony</h2>
<p>If you are using Symfony, and experiencing this error when uploading to a server, then it can be that the app's cache hasn't been reset, either because <code>app/cache</code> has been uploaded, or that cache hasn't been cleared.</p>
<p>You can test and fix this by running the following console command:</p>
<pre><code>cache:clear
</code></pre>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>4. Non ACSII characters inside Zip file</h2>
<p>Apparently, this error can happen also upon calling <code>zip-&gt;close()</code> when some files inside the zip have non-ASCII characters in their filename, such as é.</p>
<p>A potential solution is to wrap the file name in <code>utf8_decode()</code> before creating the target file.</p>
<p><em>Credits to <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/users/4217158/fran-cano>Fran Cano</a> for identifying and suggesting a solution to this issue</em></p>","<p>To add to the (really good) existing answer</p>
<h1>Shared Hosting Software</h1>
<p><code>open_basedir</code> is one that can stump you because it can be specified in a web server configuration. While this is easily remedied if you run your own dedicated server, there are some shared hosting software packages out there (like Plesk, cPanel, etc) that will configure a configuration directive on a per-domain basis. Because the software builds the configuration file (i.e. <code>httpd.conf</code>) you cannot change that file directly because the hosting software will just overwrite it when it restarts.</p>
<p>With Plesk, they provide a place to override the provided <code>httpd.conf</code> called <code>vhost.conf</code>. Only the server admin can write this file. The configuration for Apache looks something like this</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www/vhosts/domain.com&gt;
    &lt;IfModule mod_php5.c&gt;
        php_admin_flag engine on
        php_admin_flag safe_mode off
        php_admin_value open_basedir /var/www/vhosts/domain.com:/tmp:/usr/share/pear:/local/PEAR
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Have your server admin consult the manual for the hosting and web server software they use.</p>
<h1>File Permissions</h1>
<p>It's important to note that executing a file through your web server is very different from a command line or cron job execution. The big difference is that your web server has its own user and permissions. For security reasons that user is pretty restricted. Apache, for instance, is often <code>apache</code>, <code>www-data</code> or <code>httpd</code> (depending on your server). A cron job or CLI execution has whatever permissions that the user running it has (i.e. running a PHP script as root will execute with permissions of root).</p>
<p>A lot of times people will solve a permissions problem by doing the following (Linux example)</p>
<pre><code>chmod 777 /path/to/file
</code></pre>
<p>This is not a smart idea, because the file or directory is now world writable. If you own the server and are the only user then this isn't such a big deal, but if you're on a shared hosting environment you've just given everyone on your server access.</p>
<p>What you need to do is determine the user(s) that need access and give only those them access. Once you know which users need access you'll want to make sure that</p>
<ol>
<li><p>That user owns the file <strong>and possibly the parent directory</strong> (especially the parent directory if you want to write files). In most shared hosting environments this won't be an issue, because your user should own all the files underneath your root. A Linux example is shown below</p>
<pre><code> chown apache:apache /path/to/file
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>The user, and only that user, has access. In Linux, a good practice would be <code>chmod 600</code> (only owner can read and write) or <code>chmod 644</code> (owner can write but everyone can read)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can <a href=https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/35711/giving-php-permission-to-write-to-files-and-folders>read a more extended discussion of Linux/Unix permissions and users here</a></p>","<ol>
<li>Look at the <strong>exact</strong> error</li>
</ol>
<p>My code worked fine on all machines but only on this one started giving problem (which used to work find I guess). Used echo document_root path to debug and also looked closely at the error, found this</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You can easily see where the problems are. The problems are // before functions</p>
<pre><code>$document_root = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
echo root: $document_root;
include($document_root.'/functions/connections.php');

<p>So simply remove the lading / from include and it should work fine. What is interesting is this behaviors is different on different versions. I run the same code on Laptop, Macbook Pro and this PC, all worked fine untill. Hope this helps someone.</p>

<li>using an uninitialized hence bogus pointer.</li>
<li>using a null pointer.</li>

<p><code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, on the other hand, <em>does not convey any meaning</em>, aside from any found in its <code>class</code>, <code>lang</code> and <code>title</code> attributes.</p>
<p>So no: using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> does not define a section in HTML.</p>
<p>From the spec:</p>
<h3><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. Each <code>section</code> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A Web site’s home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element instead. A general rule is that the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element is appropriate only if the element’s contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline.</strong></p>

<h3><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the <code>class</code>, <code>lang</code>, and <code>title</code> attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Authors are strongly encouraged to view the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.</p>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Shows this compile time error:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Cat is not abstract and does not override abstract method roar() in Animal
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why won't it compile?</strong></p>
<p>Because:</p>
<ol>
<li>You created a class Cat which implements an interface Animal.</li>
<li>Your interface called Animal has an abstract method called roar which must be overridden.</li>
<li>You didn't provide for method roar.  There are many ways to eliminate the compile time error.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Remedy 1, have Cat override the abstract method roar()</strong></p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23058029/missing-return-statement-within-if-for-while,"java - ""Missing return statement"" within if / for / while","<p>If you put a return statement in the <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> statement then it may or may not return a value. If it will not go inside these statements then also that method should return some value (that could be null). To ensure that, compiler will force you to write this return statement which is after <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> or <code>for</code>.</p>
<p>But if you write an <code>if</code> / <code>else</code> block and each one of them is having a return in it then the compiler knows that either the <code>if</code> or <code>else</code> will get executed and the method will return a value. So this time the compiler will not force you.</p>
<pre><code>if(condition)
{
    return;
}
else
{
    return;
}
</code></pre>","<p>That's because the function <strong>needs</strong> to return a value. Imagine what happens if you execute <code>myMethod()</code> and it doesn't go into <code>if(condition)</code> what would your function return? The compiler needs to know what to return in every possible execution of your function.</p>
<p>Checking Java documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definition: If a method declaration has a return type then there must
be a return statement at the end of the method. If the return
statement is not there the missing return statement error is thrown.</p>
<p>This error is also thrown if the method does not have a return type
and has not been declared using void (i.e., it was mistakenly
omitted).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can do this to solve your problem:</p>
<pre><code>public String myMethod()
{
    String result = null;
    if(condition)
    {
        result = x;
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>","<p>That is <strong>illegal syntax</strong>. It is <strong>not</strong> an <strong>optional</strong> thing for you to return a variable. You <em>must</em> return a variable of the type you specify in your method.</p>
<pre><code>public String myMethod()
{
    if(condition)
    {
        return x;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You are effectively saying: <em>I promise</em> any class can use this method (public) and I promise it will always return a String (String).</p>
<p>Then you are saying IF my condition is true I will return x. Well, that is too bad. There isn't any IF in your promise. You promised that myMethod will <em>always</em> return a String.</p>
<p>Even if your condition is <em>always</em> true, the compiler has to assume that there is a possibility of it being false. Therefore you always need to put a return at the end of your non-void method outside of any conditions <em>just in case</em> all of your conditions fail.</p>
<pre><code>public String myMethod()
{
    if(condition)

        return x;

Specifically:</p>
<pre><code>if (typeof variable !== 'undefined') {
    // the variable is defined
}
</code></pre>","<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator will check if the variable is really undefined.</p>
<pre><code>if (typeof variable === 'undefined') {
    // variable is undefined
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator, unlike the other operators, doesn't throw a <em>ReferenceError</em> exception when used with an undeclared variable.</p>
<p>However, do note that <code>typeof null</code> will return <code>object</code>. We have to be careful to avoid the mistake of initializing a variable to <code>null</code>. To be safe, this is what we could use instead:</p>
<pre><code>if (typeof variable === 'undefined' || variable === null) {
    // variable is undefined or null
}
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>For more info on using strict comparison <code>===</code> instead of simple equality <code>==</code>, see:<br/><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/q/359494/584192>Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons?</a></p>","<p>In many cases, using:</p>
<pre><code>if (elem) { // or !elem

<ol>
<li><strong>undefined</strong>: if the value is not defined and it's <code>undefined</code></li>
<li><strong>null</strong>: if it's null, for example, if a DOM element not exists...</li>
<li><strong>empty string</strong>: <code>''</code> </li>
<li><strong>0</strong>: number zero</li>
<li><strong>NaN</strong>: not a number</li>
<li><strong>false</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>So it will cover off kind of all cases, but there are always weird cases which we'd like to cover as well, for example, a string with spaces, like this <code>'    '</code> one, this will be defined in javascript as it has spaces inside string... for example in this case you add one more check using trim(), like:</p>
<pre><code>if(elem) {

if(typeof elem === 'string' &amp;&amp; elem.trim()) {
///

<p>When you have a message like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged, # and have 1 and 1 different commit(s) each, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>, check if you <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2298556/branches-have-apparently-diverged-but-commit-history-is-identical>need to update <code>origin</code></a>. If <code>origin</code> is up-to-date, then some commits have been pushed to <code>origin</code> from another repo while you made your own commits locally.</p>
<pre><code>... o ---- o ---- A ---- B  origin/master (upstream work)
                   \
                    C  master (your work)
</code></pre>
<p>You based commit C on commit A because that was the latest work you had fetched from upstream at the time.</p>
<p>However, before you tried to push back to origin, someone else pushed commit B.<br/>
Development history has diverged into separate paths. </p>
<p>You can then merge or rebase. See <a href=http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing rel=noreferrer>Pro Git: Git Branching - Rebasing</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Merge</strong></p>
<p>Use the git merge command:</p>
<pre><code>$ git merge origin/master
</code></pre>
<p>This tells Git to integrate the changes from <code>origin/master</code> into your work and create a merge commit.<br/>
The graph of history now looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>... o ---- o ---- A ---- B  origin/master (upstream work)
                   \      \
                    C ---- M  master (your work)
</code></pre>
<p>The new merge, commit M, has two parents, each representing one path of development that led to the content stored in that commit.</p>
<p>Note that the history behind M is now non-linear.</p>
<p><strong>Rebase</strong></p>
<p>Use the git rebase command:</p>
<pre><code>$ git rebase origin/master
</code></pre>
<p>This tells Git to replay commit C (your work) as if you had based it on commit B instead of A.<br/>
CVS and Subversion users routinely rebase their local changes on top of upstream work when they update before commit.<br/>
Git just adds explicit separation between the commit and rebase steps.</p>
<p>The graph of history now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>... o ---- o ---- A ---- B  origin/master (upstream work)
                          \
                           C'  master (your work)
</code></pre>
<p>Commit C' is a new commit created by the git rebase command.<br/>
It is different from C in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a different history: B instead of A.</li>
<li>Its content accounts for changes in both B and C; it is the same as M from the merge example. </li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the history behind C' is still linear.<br/>
We have chosen (for now) to allow only linear history in <code>cmake.org/cmake.git</code>.<br/>
This approach preserves the CVS-based workflow used previously and may ease the transition.<br/>
An attempt to push C' into our repository will work (assuming you have permissions and no one has pushed while you were rebasing).</p>
<p>The git pull command provides a shorthand way to fetch from origin and rebase local work on it:</p>
<pre><code>$ git pull --rebase
</code></pre>
<p>This combines the above fetch and rebase steps into one command. </p>","<p>I had this and am mystified as to what has caused it, even after reading the above responses.  My solution was to do</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard origin/master
</code></pre>
<p>Then that just resets my (local) copy of master (which I assume is screwed up) to the correct point, as represented by (remote) origin/master.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: You will lose all changes not yet pushed to <code>origin/master</code>.</p>
</blockquote>","<pre><code>git pull --rebase origin/master

<pre><code>Problem: I received the following warning:
</code></pre>
<p><strong>warning</strong>: control reaches end of non-void function</p>
<p>Solution: This warning is similar to the warning described in Return with no value. If control reaches the end of a function and no return is encountered, GCC assumes a return with no return value. However, for this, the function requires a return value. At the end of the function, add a return statement that returns a suitable return value, even if control never reaches there.</p>

    my_strcpy(strB, strA);
    puts(strB);
    return 0;

I had an issue where I was attempting to present a modal view controller within the <code>viewDidLoad</code> method. The solution for me was to move this call to the <code>viewDidAppear:</code> method.</p>
<p>My presumption is that the view controller's view <strong><em>is not</em></strong> in the window's view hierarchy at the point that it has been loaded (when the <code>viewDidLoad</code> message is sent), but it <strong><em>is</em></strong> in the window hierarchy after it has been presented (when the <code>viewDidAppear:</code> message is sent).</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Caution</strong></p>
<p>If you do make a call to <code>presentViewController:animated:completion:</code> in the <code>viewDidAppear:</code> you may run into an issue whereby the modal view controller is always being presented whenever the view controller's view appears (which makes sense!) and so the modal view controller being presented will never go away...</p>
<p>Maybe this isn't the best place to present the modal view controller, or perhaps some additional state needs to be kept which allows the presenting view controller to decide whether or not it should present the modal view controller immediately.</p>","<p>Another potential cause:</p>
<p>I had this issue when I was accidentally presenting the same view controller twice. (Once with <code>performSegueWithIdentifer:sender:</code> which was called when the button was pressed, and a second time with a segue connected directly to the button).</p>
<p>Effectively, two segues were firing at the same time, and I got the error: <code>Attempt to present X on Y whose view is not in the window hierarchy!</code></p>",<p><code>viewWillLayoutSubviews</code> and <code>viewDidLayoutSubviews</code> (iOS 5.0+) can be used for this purpose.

<p>The issue that arose here is that localhost uses a UNIX socket and can not find the database in the standard directory.

<hr/>
<p><strong>In Math</strong>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit rel=noreferrer>Logit</a> is a function that maps probabilities (<code>[0, 1]</code>) to R (<code>(-inf, inf)</code>)</p>

<p><strong>In ML</strong>, it <a href=https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#logits rel=noreferrer>can be</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the vector of raw (non-normalized) predictions that a classification

  function. If the model is solving a multi-class classification
  problem, logits typically become an input to the softmax function. The
  softmax function then generates a vector of (normalized) probabilities
  with one value for each possible class.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Yes, <code>logit</code>  as a mathematical <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit rel=noreferrer>function</a> in statistics, <strong>but the <code>logit</code> used in context of neural networks is different.</strong> Statistical <code>logit</code> doesn't even make any sense here.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I couldn't find a formal definition anywhere, but <code>logit</code> basically means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The raw predictions which come out of the last layer of the neural network.<br/>
  1. This is the very tensor on which you apply the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arg_max rel=noreferrer><code>argmax</code></a> function to get the predicted class.<br/>
  2. This is the very tensor which you feed into the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function rel=noreferrer><code>softmax</code></a> function to get the probabilities for the predicted classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Also, from a <a href=https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers rel=noreferrer>tutorial</a> on official tensorflow website:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Logits Layer</h3>
<p>The final layer in our neural network is the logits layer, which will return the raw values for our predictions. We create a dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each target class 0–9), with linear activation (the default):</p>
<pre><code>logits = tf.layers.dense(inputs=dropout, units=10)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>If you are still confused, the situation is like this:</p>
<pre><code>raw_predictions = neural_net(input_layer)
predicted_class_index_by_raw = argmax(raw_predictions)
probabilities = softmax(raw_predictions)
predicted_class_index_by_prob = argmax(probabilities)
</code></pre>
<p>where, <code>predicted_class_index_by_raw</code> and <code>predicted_class_index_by_prob</code> will be equal.</p>
<p><strong>Another name for <code>raw_predictions</code> in the above code is <code>logit</code></strong>.</p>

<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Although, if you want to, you can apply statistical <code>logit</code> to <code>probabilities</code> that come out of the <code>softmax</code> function. </p>
<p>If the probability of a certain class is <code>p</code>,<br/>
Then the <strong>log-odds</strong> of that class is <code>L = logit(p)</code>.</p>
<p>Also, the probability of that class can be recovered as <code>p = sigmoid(L)</code>, using the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function rel=noreferrer><code>sigmoid</code></a> function.</p>
<p>Not very useful to calculate log-odds though.</p>","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In context of deep learning the <a href=https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn#logits_layer rel=noreferrer>logits layer</a> means the layer that feeds in to softmax (or other such normalization). The output of the softmax are the probabilities for the classification task and its input is logits layer. The logits layer typically produces values from -infinity to +infinity and the softmax layer transforms it to values from 0 to 1.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Context</strong></p>
<p>Where does this term comes from? In 1930s and 40s, several people were trying to adapt linear regression to the problem of predicting probabilities. However linear regression produces output from -infinity to +infinity while for probabilities our desired output is 0 to 1. One way to do this is by somehow mapping the probabilities 0 to 1 to -infinity to +infinity and then use linear regression as usual. One such mapping is cumulative normal distribution that was used by Chester Ittner Bliss in 1934 and he called this probit model, short for probability unit. However this function is computationally expensive while lacking some of the desirable properties for multi-class classification. In 1944 Joseph Berkson used the function <code>log(p/(1-p))</code> to do this mapping and called it logit, short for logistic unit. The term logistic regression derived from this as well.</p>
<p><strong>The Confusion</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately the term logits is abused in deep learning. From pure mathematical perspective logit is a <em>function</em> that performs above mapping. In deep learning people started calling the layer logits layer that feeds in to logit function. Then people started calling the output <em>values</em> of this layer logit creating the confusion with logit <em>the function</em>.</p>
<p><strong>TensorFlow Code</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately TensorFlow code further adds in to confusion by names like <code>tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits</code>. What does logits mean here? It just means the input of the function is supposed to be the output of last neuron layer as described above. The <code>_with_logits</code> suffix is <a href=https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6531 rel=noreferrer>redundant, confusing and pointless</a>. Functions should be named without regards to such very specific contexts because they are simply mathematical operations that can be performed on values derived from many other domains. In fact TensorFlow has another similar function <code>sparse_softmax_cross_entropy</code> where they fortunately forgot to add <code>_with_logits</code> suffix creating inconsistency and adding in to confusion. PyTorch on the other hand simply names its function without these kind of suffixes.</p>
<p><strong>Reference</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=http://www.columbia.edu/~so33/SusDev/Lecture_9.pdf rel=noreferrer>Logit/Probit lecture slides</a> is one of the best resource to understand logit. I have also updated <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit rel=noreferrer>Wikipedia article</a> with some of above information.</p>"

<p>The Python import mechanism works relative to the <code>__name__</code> of the current file.  When you execute a file directly, it doesn't have its usual name, but has <code>__main__</code> as its name instead.  So relative imports don't work.</p>
<p>You can, as Igancio suggested, execute it using the <code>-m</code> option.  If you have a part of your package that is meant to be run as a script, you can also use the <code>__package__</code> attribute to tell that file what name it's supposed to have in the package hierarchy. </p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/604831/collection-was-modified-enumeration-operation-may-not-execute/604843,c# - Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute,"<p>What's likely happening is that <code>SignalData</code> is indirectly changing the subscribers dictionary under the hood during the loop and leading to that message.  You can verify this by changing</p>
<pre><code>foreach(Subscriber s in subscribers.Values)
</code></pre>
<p>To</p>
<pre><code>foreach(Subscriber s in subscribers.Values.ToList())
</code></pre>
<p>If I'm right, the problem will disappear.</p>
<p>Calling <code>subscribers.Values.ToList()</code> copies the values of <code>subscribers.Values</code> to a separate list at the start of the <code>foreach</code>. Nothing else has access to this list (it doesn't even have a variable name!), so nothing can modify it inside the loop.</p>","<p>When a subscriber unsubscribes you are changing contents of the collection of Subscribers during enumeration.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this, one being changing the for loop to use an explicit <code>.ToList()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>public void NotifySubscribers(DataRecord sr)  
{
    foreach(Subscriber s in subscribers.Values.ToList())
    {
                                              ^^^^^^^^^  
        ...
</code></pre>","<p>A more efficient way, in my opinion, is to have another list that you declare that you put anything that is to be removed into.  Then after you finish your main loop (without the .ToList()), you do another loop over the to be removed list, removing each entry as it happens.  So in your class you add:</p>
<pre><code>private List&lt;Guid&gt; toBeRemoved = new List&lt;Guid&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p>Then you change it to:</p>
<pre><code>public void NotifySubscribers(DataRecord sr)
{
    toBeRemoved.Clear();

    ...your unchanged code skipped...

   foreach ( Guid clientId in toBeRemoved )
   {
        try
        {
            subscribers.Remove(clientId);
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(Unsubscribe Error  + 
                e.Message);
        }
   }
}

...your unchanged code skipped...

public void UnsubscribeEvent(Guid clientId)
{
    toBeRemoved.Add( clientId );
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will not only solve your problem, it will prevent you from having to keep creating a list from your dictionary, which is expensive if there are a lot of subscribers in there.  Assuming the list of subscribers to be removed on any given iteration is lower than the total number in the list, this should be faster.  But of course feel free to profile it to be sure that's the case if there's any doubt in your specific usage situation.</p>"

<p>Here you load the address into A0 and the size (7) into A1:</p>
<pre><code>        la  $a0,array   
        lw  $a1,size    #a1 = size of array
</code></pre>
<p>Here you load the first word stored at your array (that will load a 10). This is not what you've intended.</p>
<pre><code>        lw $s0,0($a0)   #copy arg1 = address array
        addi $s1,$zero,7
</code></pre>
<p>Here you load the first word stored at location 0x000007. (your size). This
is probably also not intended and will cause an exception because the address is not aligned:</p>
<pre><code>        lw $s1,0($a1)   #copy arg2 = size of array
</code></pre>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that you have a misunderstanding what the LW instruction does. It reads a memory location into a register. What you want in the prolog of your loop is to make copies of a register.</p>
<p>To do so you can use the move pseudo instruction if your assembler supports it. Otherwise use the OR instruction to copy registers like this:</p>
<pre><code>COUNT:
            or    $s0, $a0, $a0   #copy arg1 = address array
            addi  $s1, $zero,7
            or    $s1, $a1, $a1   #copy arg2 = size of array
            or    $s2, $a2, $a2   #copy arg3 = search key (n)
            addi  $s2, $zero,30
            COUNTLOOP:

            ...
</code></pre>
<p>for a complete example of a linear search loop try this (untested and expects that the assembler cares about the delay slots)</p>
<pre><code>main:

            la  $a0,array            # $a0 = address of array
            lw  $a1,size             # $a1  = size of array
            lw  $a2,search           # $a2 = search key


            beq $a1, $zero, NOTFOUND # handle the size==0 case..

When you say</p>
<pre><code>return candidate;

<p>you return a pointer to char.  (This is due to the very close relationship between arrays and pointers in C, which you will have to learn about if you don't know yet.)  But you've stated that your function <code>getkey</code> returns a char, not a pointer-to-char.</p>
<p>You need to make the function's return value match its type.  You might want change the <code>return</code> statement so it returns a single char.  If you want to have the function return a whole string, you could change its declaration to <code>char *getkey()</code>, but in that case you'll also have to take care of the allocation of the <code>candidate</code> array.</p>
<p>Here's what the warning means.  You tried to return a pointer.  The function is supposed to return a character, which is represented as a small integer.  The compile is willing to try to convert the pointer to an integer, in case that's what you really want to do, but since that's not usually a good idea, it warns you.  Indeed, in this case the warning tells you that you probably made a mistake.</p>","<p><code>getkey</code> has been declared to return a <code>char</code>, but you're trying to return <code>candidate</code> which is a <code>char</code> array.</p>
<p>You probably meant to return one of the elements in the array, i.e. something like <code>candidate[x]</code>.</p>
<p>The reason for the error message saying pointer instead of array is that the compiler is converting <code>candidate</code> to a pointer to the first element in the array, which happens implicitly in some contexts, for example when returning, since arrays can't be returned (or passed as parameters) by value in C (see <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/q/1461432/3425536>What is array decaying?</a>).</p>",

</code></pre>","<p>React element has to return only one element. You'll have to wrap both of your tags with another element tag.</p>

  reference-to-<code>deckOfCards</code>, but there is no such function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Error:</p>
<pre><code>[Note] candidate is:

In file included from main.cpp

[Note] void deckOfCards::shuffle(std::vector&amp;)
</code></pre>
<p>Paraphrased:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean, maybe you meant this other function called <code>shuffle</code>, but that
  one takes a reference-to<code>vector&lt;something&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Error:</p>

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Which I'd be happy to call if I knew how to convert from a
  <code>deckOfCards</code> to a <code>vector</code>; but I don't.  So I won't.</p>
</blockquote>","<p>to add to John's answer:</p>
<p>what you want to pass to the <code>shuffle</code> function is a deck of cards from the class <code>deckOfCards</code> that you've declared in main; however, the deck of cards or <code>vector&lt;Card&gt; deck</code> that you've declared in your class is private, so not accessible from outside the class. this means you'd want a getter function, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>class deckOfCards
{
    private:
        vector&lt;Card&gt; deck;

    public:
        deckOfCards();
        static int count;
        static int next;
        void shuffle(vector&lt;Card&gt;&amp; deck);
        Card dealCard();
        bool moreCards();
        vector&lt;Card&gt;&amp; getDeck() {   //GETTER
            return deck;
        }
};
</code></pre>
<p>this will in turn allow you to call your shuffle function from main like this:</p>
<pre><code>deckOfCards cardDeck; // create DeckOfCards object
cardDeck.shuffle(cardDeck.getDeck()); // shuffle the cards in the deck
</code></pre>
<p>however, you have more problems, specifically when calling <code>cout</code>. first, you're calling the <code>dealCard</code> function wrongly; as <code>dealCard</code> is a memeber function of a class, you should be calling it like this <code>cardDeck.dealCard();</code> instead of this <code>dealCard(cardDeck);</code>.</p>
<p>now, we come to your second problem - print to standard output. you're trying to print your deal card, which is an object of type <code>Card</code> by using the following instruction:</p>
<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; cardDeck.dealCard();// deal the cards in the deck
</code></pre>
<p>yet, the <code>cout</code> doesn't know how to print it, as it's not a standard type. this means you should <a href=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators rel=noreferrer>overload</a> your <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator to print whatever you want it to print when calling with a <code>Card</code> type.</p>",
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6608775/please-initialize-the-log4j-system-properly-while-running-web-service,java - Please initialize the log4j system properly. While running web service,"<p>Those messages are something tricky, enough so that people created this to make it clearer:
<a href=https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25747 rel=noreferrer>https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25747</a></p>
<p>What's tricky about them is that the warnings are written if Log4j can't find its <code>log4j.properties</code> (or <code>log4j.xml</code>) file, but also if the file is fine and dandy but its content is not complete from a configuration point of view.</p>
<p>The following paragraph is taken from here:
<a href=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/tags/v1_2_9/docs/TROUBLESHOOT.html rel=noreferrer>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/tags/v1_2_9/docs/TROUBLESHOOT.html</a></p>
<p><em>Logging output is written to a target by using an appender. If no appenders are attached to a category nor to any of its ancestors, you will get the following message when trying to log:</em></p>
<pre><code>log4j: No appenders could be found for category (some.category.name).
log4j: Please initialize the log4j system properly.
</code></pre>
<p><em>Log4j does not have a default logging target. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that all categories can inherit an appender. This can be easily achieved by attaching an appender to the root category.</em></p>
<p>You can find info on how to configure the root logger (<code>log4j.rootLogger</code>) in the log4j <a href=http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html rel=noreferrer>documentation</a>, basically adding something as simple as this at the beginning of the file: </p>
<pre><code>log4j.rootLogger=debug, stdout
log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%-4r [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m%n
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This should clear those WARN messages you get on startup</strong> (make sure you don't already have an appender named <code>stdout</code>; also be carefull of what level you give the root logger, <code>debug</code> will be very verbose and every library in your app will start writing stuff to the console).</p>
<p>As about the <code>log4j.properties</code>/<code>log4j.xml</code>, I suggest you place this file in <code>/WEB-INF/classes</code> as it is important to have it exposed for different tweaks (activating/deactivating logs, changing log levels etc). You can have it inside a JAR in the classpath also (as you specified in your comment), but it will be enclosed in the archive (hopefully in the right place inside the archive) and won't be as easy to handle as if it were in <code>/WEB-INF/classes</code>.</p>",<p>You have to create your own <code>log4j.properties</code> in the classpath folder.</p>,"<p>Well, if you had already created the log4j.properties you would add its path to the classpath so it would be found during execution.<br/> Yes, the thingy will search for this file in the classpath.<br/>
Since you said you looked into axis and didnt find one, I am assuming you dont have a log4j.properties, so here's a crude but complete example. <br/>
Create it somewhere and add to your classpath. Put it for example, in c:/proj/resources/log4j.properties<br/><br/>
In your classpath you simple add .......;c:/proj/resources</p>

<p>This means that you have tried to run a program that used some class that has not compiled correctly.</p>
<p>Go back and fix the compilation error(s).</p>
<p>It is not clear what the fix for the compilation error should be, but the error is saying that it cannot find a class called <code>TeamLeader</code>.  Perhaps it doesn't exist.  Perhaps it is in a different package.  Perhaps you haven't compiled it.  Perhaps something else.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Looking at the code, I think the problem is that you have defined <em>two distinct classes</em> called <code>TeamLeadDemo</code>, one as a nested class of <code>Employee</code> and the second as a top-level class.  Furthermore the second of these is attempting to use <code>TeamLeader</code> ... but the <code>TeamLeader</code> class that you have actually declared is nested 2 levels down in <code>Employee</code>; i.e. its real name is <code>Employee.ShiftSupervisor.TeamLeader</code>.</p>
<p>This is all a bit nonsensical.</p>
<p>By the look of it, you defined a whole bunch of classes in the same file (Employee.java) without much understanding of what it means to put one class inside another.  Most likely, each of those classes should be declared in its own file.  And most likely you should just delete the nested <code>TeamLeadDemo</code> class.</p>"

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14768230/malloc-for-struct-and-pointer-in-c,memory management - malloc for struct and pointer in C,"<p>No, you're <em>not</em> allocating memory for <code>y-&gt;x</code> twice.</p>
<p>Instead, you're allocating memory for the structure (which includes a pointer) <em>plus</em> something for that pointer to point to.</p>
<p>Think of it this way:</p>
<pre><code>         1          2
        +-----+    +------+
y------&gt;|  x------&gt;|  *x  |
        |  n  |    +------+
        +-----+
</code></pre>
<p>So you actually need the two allocations (<code>1</code> and <code>2</code>) to store everything.</p>
<p>Additionally, your type should be <code>struct Vector *y</code> since it's a pointer, and you should never cast the return value from <code>malloc</code> in C since it can hide certain problems you don't want hidden - C is perfectly capable of implicitly converting the <code>void*</code> return value to any other pointer.</p>
<p>And, of course, you probably want to encapsulate the creation of these vectors to make management of them easier, such as with:</p>
<pre><code>struct Vector {
    double *data;    // no place for x and n in readable code :-)
    size_t size;
};

struct Vector *newVector (size_t sz) {
    // Try to allocate vector structure.

    struct Vector *retVal = malloc (sizeof (struct Vector));
    if (retVal == NULL)
        return NULL;

    // Try to allocate vector data, free structure if fail.

    retVal-&gt;data = malloc (sz * sizeof (double));
    if (retVal-&gt;data == NULL) {
        free (retVal);
        return NULL;
    }

    // Set size and return.

    retVal-&gt;size = sz;
    return retVal;
}

void delVector (struct Vector *vector) {
    // Can safely assume vector is NULL or fully built.

    if (vector != NULL) {
        free (vector-&gt;data);
        free (vector);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By encapsulating the creation like that, you ensure that vectors are either fully built or not built at all - there's no chance of them being half-built. It also allows you to totally change the underlying data structures in future without affecting clients (for example, if you wanted to make them sparse arrays to trade off space for speed).</p>","<p>The first time around, you allocate memory for <code>Vector</code>, which means the variables <code>x</code>,<code>n</code>.</p>
<p>However <code>x</code> <strong>doesn't yet point to anything useful</strong>.</p>
<p>So that is why <strong>second allocation is needed as well</strong>.</p>","<p>In principle you're doing it correct already. For what you want you do need two <code>malloc()</code>s.</p>
<p>Just some comments:</p>
<pre><code>struct Vector y = (struct Vector*)malloc(sizeof(struct Vector));
y-&gt;x = (double*)malloc(10*sizeof(double));
</code></pre>
<p>should be</p>
<pre><code>struct Vector *y = malloc(sizeof *y); /* Note the pointer */
y-&gt;x = calloc(10, sizeof *y-&gt;x);
</code></pre>
<p>In the first line, you allocate memory for a Vector object. <code>malloc()</code> returns a pointer to the allocated memory, so y must be a Vector pointer. In the second line you allocate memory for an array of 10 doubles. </p>
<p>In C you don't need the explicit casts, and writing <code>sizeof *y</code> instead of <code>sizeof(struct Vector)</code> is better for type safety, and besides, it saves on typing.</p>
<p>You can rearrange your struct and do a single <code>malloc()</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>struct Vector{    
    int n;
    double x[];
};
struct Vector *y = malloc(sizeof *y + 10 * sizeof(double));

<p>Firstly, if you're certain that you're extending from the correctly named class, e.g. <strong>React.Component</strong>, not React.component or React.createComponent, you may need to upgrade your React version. See answers below for more information on the classes to extend from.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade React</strong></p>
<p>React has only supported ES6-style classes since version 0.13.0 (see their official blog post on the support introduction <a href=https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html rel=noreferrer title=React v0.13.0 Beta 1 React Blog>here</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, when using:</p>
<pre><code>class HelloMessage extends React.Component
</code></pre>
<p>you were attempting to use ES6 keywords (<code>extends</code>) to subclass from a class which wasn't defined using ES6 <code>class</code>. This was likely why you were running into strange behaviour with <code>super</code> definitions etc.</p>
<p>So, yes, <strong>TL;DR</strong> - update to React v0.13.x.</p>
<p><strong>Circular Dependencies</strong></p>
<p>This can also occur if you have circular import structure. One module importing another and the other way around. In this case you just need to refactor your code to avoid it. <a href=https://medium.com/content-uneditable/circular-dependencies-in-javascript-a-k-a-coding-is-not-a-rock-paper-scissors-game-9c2a9eccd4bc#.9nppw7oqv rel=noreferrer>More info</a></p>","<p>This means that you want subclass something, which should be <code>Class</code>, but is <code>undefined</code>. The reasons might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>typo in <code>Class extends ...</code>, so you extending undefined variable</li>
<li>typo in <code>import ... from</code>, so you import <code>undefined</code> from module</li>
<li>referenced module does not contain the value, you want import (e.g. obsolete module - case with React), so you importing non existing value (<code>undefined</code>)</li>
<li>typo in referenced module <code>export ...</code> statement, so it exports undefined variable</li>
<li>referenced module missing <code>export</code> statement at all, so it exports just <code>undefined</code></li>
</ul>","<p>It can also be caused by a typo error, so instead of <code>Component</code> with capital C, you have <code>component</code> with lower c, for example: </p>
<pre><code>React.component //wrong.
React.Component //correct.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
The source of this error is may be because there is <code>React</code> and we think automatically what comes next should be a react method or property starting with a lowercase letter, but in fact it is another <strong>Class</strong>(<code>Component</code>) which should start with a capital case letter.</p>"

The .length property can only be applied to arrays in object oriented programming (OOP) languages.  The .length property is inherited from the object class; the class all other classes &amp; objects inherit from in an OOP language.  Also, one would use .length-1 to return the number of the last index in an array; using just the .length will return the total length of the array.</p>
<p>I would suggest something like this:</p>
<pre><code>int index;
int jdex;

<p>The line (sizeof( my_array ) / sizeof( my_array[0] )) will give you the size of the array in question.  The sizeof property will return the length in bytes, so one must divide the total size of the array in bytes by how many bytes make up each element, each element takes up 4 bytes because each element is of type int, respectively. The array is of total size 16 bytes and each element is of 4 bytes so 16/4 yields 4 the total number of elements in your array because indexing starts at 0 and not 1.</p>","<p>It looks like you have a typo on your array, it should read:</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38848759/valueerror-all-the-input-arrays-must-have-same-number-of-dimensions,python - ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions,"<p>If I start with a 3x4 array, and concatenate a 3x1 array, with axis 1, I get a 3x5 array:</p>
<pre><code>In [911]: x = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
In [912]: np.concatenate([x,x[:,-1:]], axis=1)
Out[912]:

In [913]: x.shape,x[:,-1:].shape
Out[913]: ((3, 4), (3, 1))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that both inputs to concatenate have 2 dimensions.</p>
<p>Omit the <code>:</code>, and <code>x[:,-1]</code> is (3,) shape - it is 1d, and hence the error:</p>
<pre><code>In [914]: np.concatenate([x,x[:,-1]], axis=1)
...
ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions
</code></pre>
<p>The code for <code>np.append</code> is (in this case where axis is specified)</p>
<pre><code>return concatenate((arr, values), axis=axis)
</code></pre>
<p>So with a slight change of syntax <code>append</code> works.  Instead of a list it takes 2 arguments.  It imitates the list <code>append</code> is syntax, but should not be confused with that list method.</p>
<pre><code>In [916]: np.append(x, x[:,-1:], axis=1)
Out[916]: 
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 11]])
</code></pre>
<p><code>np.hstack</code> first makes sure all inputs are <code>atleast_1d</code>, and then does concatenate:</p>
<pre><code>return np.concatenate([np.atleast_1d(a) for a in arrs], 1)
</code></pre>
<p>So it requires the same <code>x[:,-1:]</code> input.  Essentially the same action.</p>
<p><code>np.column_stack</code> also does a concatenate on axis 1.  But first it passes 1d inputs through</p>
<pre><code>array(arr, copy=False, subok=True, ndmin=2).T
</code></pre>
<p>This is a general way of turning that (3,) array into a (3,1) array.</p>
<pre><code>In [922]: np.array(x[:,-1], copy=False, subok=True, ndmin=2).T
Out[922]: 
array([[ 3],

<p>All these 'stacks' can be convenient, but in the long run, it's important to understand dimensions and the base <code>np.concatenate</code>.  Also know how to look up the code for functions like this.  I use the <code>ipython</code> <code>??</code> magic a lot.</p>
<p>And in time tests, the <code>np.concatenate</code> is noticeably faster - with a small array like this the extra layers of function calls makes a big time difference.</p>","<p>(n,) and (n,1) are not the same shape. Try casting the vector to an array by using the <code>[:, None]</code> notation:</p>
<pre><code>n_lists = np.append(n_list_converted, n_last[:, None], axis=1)
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, when extracting <code>n_last</code> you can use</p>
<pre><code>n_last = n_list_converted[:, -1:]
</code></pre>
<p>to get a <code>(20, 1)</code> array.</p>","<p>The reason why you get your error is because a 1 by n matrix is different from an array of length n.</p>
<p>I recommend using <code>hstack()</code> and <code>vstack()</code> instead.
Like this:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
a = np.arange(32).reshape(4,8) # 4 rows 8 columns matrix.
b = a[:,-1:]                    # last column of that matrix.

result = np.hstack((a,b))       # stack them horizontally like this:
#array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  7],
#       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15],

#       [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 31]])
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the repeated 7, 15, 23, 31 column.
Also, notice that I used <code>a[:,-1:]</code> instead of <code>a[:,-1]</code>. My version generates a column:</p>
<pre><code>array([[7],
       [15],
       [23],

<p><strong>B</strong>.From the Editor and on the <em>Project</em> tab right click on the script CubeScript, select <em>Find References In Scene</em>. </p>
<p><strong>C</strong>.Unity will now only show all the GameObjects that has this script attached to them. Delete the old script.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3660901/a-warning-comparison-between-signed-and-unsigned-integer-expressions,c++ - A warning - comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions,"<p>It is usually a good idea to declare variables as <code>unsigned</code> or <code>size_t</code> if they will be compared to sizes, to avoid this issue.  Whenever possible, use the exact type you will be comparing against (for example, use <code>std::string::size_type</code> when comparing with a <code>std::string</code>'s length).</p>
<p>Compilers give warnings about comparing signed and unsigned types because the ranges of signed and unsigned ints are different, and when they are compared to one another, the results can be surprising.  If you have to make such a comparison, you should explicitly convert one of the values to a type compatible with the other, perhaps after checking to ensure that the conversion is valid.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>unsigned u = GetSomeUnsignedValue();
int i = GetSomeSignedValue();

if (i &gt;= 0)
{
    // i is nonnegative, so it is safe to cast to unsigned value
    if ((unsigned)i &gt;= u)
        iIsGreaterThanOrEqualToU();
    else
        iIsLessThanU();
}
else
{
    iIsNegative();
}
</code></pre>","<p>I had the exact same problem yesterday working through problem 2-3 in Accelerated C++. The key is to change all variables you will be comparing (using Boolean operators) to compatible types. In this case, that means <code>string::size_type</code> (or <code>unsigned int</code>, but since this example is using the former, I will just stick with that even though the two are technically compatible). </p>
<p>Notice that in their original code they did exactly this for the c counter (page 30 in Section 2.5 of the book), as you rightly pointed out.</p>
<p>What makes this example more complicated is that the different padding variables (padsides and padtopbottom), as well as all counters, must <em>also</em> be changed to <code>string::size_type</code>. </p>
<p>Getting to your example, the code that you posted would end up looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; Please enter the size of the frame between top and bottom;
string::size_type padtopbottom;
cin &gt;&gt; padtopbottom;

cout &lt;&lt; Please enter size of the frame from each side you would like: ;
string::size_type padsides; 
cin &gt;&gt; padsides;

string::size_type c = 0; // definition of c in the program

if (r == padtopbottom + 1 &amp;&amp; c == padsides + 1) { // where the error no longer occurs
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that in the previous conditional, you would get the error if you didn't initialize variable r as a <code>string::size_type</code> in the <code>for</code> loop. So you need to initialize the for loop using something like:</p>
<pre><code>    for (string::size_type r=0; r!=rows; ++r)   //If r and rows are string::size_type, no error!
</code></pre>
<p>So, basically, once you introduce a <code>string::size_type</code> variable into the mix, any time you want to perform a boolean operation on that item, all operands must have a compatible type for it to compile without warnings.</p>","<p>The important difference between signed and unsigned ints
is the interpretation of the last bit. The last bit
in signed types represent the sign of the number, meaning:
e.g:</p>
<p>0001 is 1    signed and unsigned
1001 is -1 signed and 9 unsigned</p>
<p>(I avoided the whole complement issue for clarity of explanation!
This is not exactly how ints are represented in memory!)</p>
<p>You can imagine that it makes a difference to know if you compare
with -1 or with +9. In many cases, programmers are just too lazy
to declare counting ints as unsigned (bloating the for loop head f.i.)
It is usually not an issue because with ints you have to count to 2^31
until your sign bit bites you. That's why it is only a warning.
Because we are too lazy to write 'unsigned' instead of 'int'.</p>"

<p>Actually you should see the errors if you drill into that array in Visual studio during debug. But you can also catch the exception and then write out the errors to some logging store or the console:</p>
<pre><code>try

    // Your code...

            Console.WriteLine(- Property: \{0}\, Error: \{1}\,
                ve.PropertyName, ve.ErrorMessage);
        }
    }
    throw;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>EntityValidationErrors</code> is a collection which represents the entities which couldn't be validated successfully, and the inner collection <code>ValidationErrors</code> per entity is a list of errors on property level.</p>
<p>These validation messages are usually helpful enough to find the source of the problem. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>A few slight improvements:</p>
<p>The <em>value</em> of the offending property can be included in the inner loop like so:</p>
<pre><code>        foreach (var ve in eve.ValidationErrors)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(- Property: \{0}\, Value: \{1}\, Error: \{2}\,

<p>While debugging <code>Debug.Write</code> might be preferable over <code>Console.WriteLine</code> as it works in all kind of applications, not only console applications (thanks to @Bart for his note in the comments below).</p>

<p>A few remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The yellow error screen that Elmah shows in the web interface or in the sent emails (if you have configured that) now displays the validation details directly at the top of the message.</p></li>
<li><p>Overwriting the <code>Message</code> property in the custom exception instead of overwriting <code>ToString()</code> has the benefit that the standard ASP.NET Yellow screen of death (YSOD) displays this message as well. In contrast to Elmah the YSOD apparently doesn't use <code>ToString()</code>, but both display the <code>Message</code> property.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrapping the original <code>DbEntityValidationException</code> as inner exception ensures that the original stack trace will still be available and is displayed in Elmah and the YSOD.</p></li>
<li><p>By setting a breakpoint on the line <code>throw newException;</code> you can simply inspect the <code>newException.Message</code> property as a text instead of drilling into the validation collections which is a bit awkward and doesn't seem to work easily for everyone (see comments below).</p></li>
</ul>","<p>You can do it from Visual Studio during debugging without writing any code, not even a catch block.</p>
<p>Just add a watch with the name:</p>
<pre><code>((System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException)$exception).EntityValidationErrors
</code></pre>
<p>The watch expression <code>$exception</code> displays any exception thrown in the current context, even if it has not been caught and assigned to a variable.</p>
<p>Based on <a href=http://mattrandle.me/viewing-entityvalidationerrors-in-visual-studio/ rel=noreferrer>http://mattrandle.me/viewing-entityvalidationerrors-in-visual-studio/</a></p>","<p>This could actually do it without having to write code: </p>
<p>In your catch block, add a break point at the following line of code:</p>
<pre><code>catch (Exception exception)
{

}
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you hover on <code>exception</code> or add it to the <code>Watch</code> and then navigate into the exception details as shown below; you will see which particular column(s) is/ are causing the problem as this error usually occurs when a table-constraint is violated..</p>

x_scaled = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(x)
df = pd.DataFrame(x_scaled)

<p>This makes use of a list comprehension, and what is happening here is similar to this structure:</p>

<p>As @AshwiniChaudhary and @KirkStrauser point out, you actually do not need to use the brackets in the one-liner, making the piece inside the parentheses a generator expression (more efficient than a list comprehension).
