https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3179672/mock-objects-setup-method-test-driven-development,unit testing - Mock objects - Setup method - Test Driven Development,"<p>The default behaviour of a Moq <code>Mock</code> object is to stub all methods and properties. This means that a call to that method/property with any parameters will not fail and will return a default value for the particular return type.</p>
<p>You call <code>Setup</code> method for any or all of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to restrict the input values to the method.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>public interface ICalculator {
  int Sum(int val1, val2);
}

var mock = new Mock&lt;ICalculator&gt;();
mock.Setup(m=&gt;m.Sum(
  It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;(), //Any value
  3                //value of 3
));
</code></pre>
<p>The above setup will match a call to method <code>Sum</code> with any value for <code>val1</code> and <code>val2</code> value of 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to return a specific value. Continuing with <code>ICalculator</code> example, the following setup will return a value of 10 regardless of the input parameters:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>var mock = new Mock&lt;ICalculator&gt;();
mock.Setup(m=&gt;m.Sum(
  It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;(), //Any value
  It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;()  //Any value
)).Returns(10);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You want to use <code>Mock&lt;T&gt;.VerifyAll()</code> after you setups to verify that all previous setups have been called (once).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>var mock = new Mock&lt;ICalculator&gt;();
mock.Setup(m=&gt;m.Sum(
  7, //value of 7
  3                //value of 3
));

mock.Setup(m=&gt;m.Sum(
  5, //value of 5
  3                //value of 3
));

mock.VerifyAll();    
</code></pre>
<p>The above code verifies that <code>Sum</code> is called twice. Once with <code>(7,3)</code> and once with <code>(5,3)</code>.</p>","<p>Setup method is used to set expectations on the mock object
For example:</p>
<pre><code>mock.Setup(foo =&gt; foo.DoSomething(ping)).Returns(true);
</code></pre>
<p>Here you are setting the <code>DoSomething</code> method on mock object. You are saying, when the parameter is ping, the method returns true.</p>
<p>Now this object can further act as a mock or a stub depending on your usage. If you want to use it in state based testing, it can act as a stub. If you want to use it in behavior based testing, it can act as a mock. In behavior testing, you will call the verify method on the mock object to assert that the method was called with ping parameter</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To use javac from JDK N to cross-compiler to an older platform version, the correct practice is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the older -source setting.</li>
<li>Set the bootclasspath to compile against the rt.jar (or equivalent) for the older platform. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the second step is not taken, javac will dutifully use the old language rules combined with new libraries, which can result in class files that do not work on the older platform since references to non-existent methods can get included. </p>
</blockquote>","<p><strong>bootclasspath usage</strong></p>
<pre><code>javac -bootclasspath /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/lib/rt.jar \
      -source 1.7 Main.java

<p>On UNIX systems, locate <code>rt.jar</code> using:</p>
<pre><code>locate -r /rt.jar$
</code></pre>
<p>Set <code>JAVA_HOME</code> so that <code>rt.jar</code> is located at <code>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/rt.jar</code>, then:</p>

<p>Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 for Oracle Java 7 and 8.</p>","<p>Im currently running Netbeans IDE 8.0.2 with JDK 1.8 on Linux Mint 17.1 which has java -version = 1.7.0_65. So to be able to run JAR files I had to set myProject&gt;Properties&gt;Source/Binary Format: JDK 7. However when building (myProject&gt;Clean and Build) I got a similar warning: warning: [options] bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 1.7. </p>
<p>The solution was to add the Linux Mint JDK1.7 platform to the Netbeans platform list. </p>
<p>This can be done by going to myProject&gt;Properties&gt;Libraries and clicking the Manage Platforms... button. Then in the Java Platform Manager window click Add Platform... and select: Java Standard Edition, click Next and browse to /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 (or whatever is the location of the JDK 1.7 version). The Platform name will be set to JDK1.7. Just click Finish and youre done.</p>
<p>You can now select the Java platform in the project properties. By selecting JDK1.7 and running Clean and Build: no more warnings. :-)</p>"

<p>Next-Generation User Experiences. The Windows Presentation Foundation, WPF, provides a unified framework for building applications and high-fidelity experiences in Windows Vista that blend application UI, documents, and media content.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16299246/what-is-the-difference-between-eq-eqv-equal-and-in-scheme,"functional programming - What is the difference between eq?, eqv?, equal?, and = in Scheme?","<p>Ill answer this question incrementally. Lets start with the <code>=</code> equivalence predicate. The <code>=</code> predicate is used to check whether two numbers are equal. If you supply it anything else but a number then it will raise an error:</p>
<pre><code>(= 2 3)     =&gt; #f
(= 2.5 2.5) =&gt; #t
(= () ()) =&gt; error
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>eq?</code> predicate is used to check whether its two parameters respresent the same object in memory. For example:</p>
<pre><code>(define x (2 3))
(define y (2 3))
(eq? x y)         =&gt; #f
(define y x)
(eq? x y)         =&gt; #t
</code></pre>
<p>Note however that theres only one empty list <code>()</code> in memory (actually the empty list doesnt exist in memory, but a pointer to the memory location <code>0</code> is considered as the empty list). Hence when comparing empty lists <code>eq?</code> will always return <code>#t</code> (because they represent the same object in memory):</p>
<pre><code>(define x ())
(define y ())
(eq? x y)      =&gt; #t
</code></pre>
<p>Now depending upon the implementation <code>eq?</code> may or may not return <code>#t</code> for  primitive values such as numbers, strings, etc. For example:</p>
<pre><code>(eq? 2 2)     =&gt; depends upon the implementation
(eq? a a) =&gt; depends upon the implementation
</code></pre>
<p>This is where the <code>eqv?</code> predicate comes into picture. The <code>eqv?</code> is exactly the same as the <code>eq?</code> predicate, except that it will always return <code>#t</code> for same primitive values. For example:</p>
<pre><code>(eqv? 2 2)     =&gt; #t
(eqv? a a) =&gt; depends upon the implementation
</code></pre>
<p>Hence <code>eqv?</code> is a superset of <code>eq?</code> and for most cases you should use <code>eqv?</code> instead of <code>eq?</code>.</p>
<p>Finally we come to the <code>equal?</code> predicate. The <code>equal?</code> predicate is exactly the same as the <code>eqv?</code> predicate, except that it can also be used to test whether two lists, vectors, etc. have corresponding elements which satisfy the <code>eqv?</code> predicate. For example:</p>
<pre><code>(define x (2 3))
(define y (2 3))
(equal? x y)      =&gt; #t
(eqv? x y)        =&gt; #f
</code></pre>
<p>In general:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <code>=</code> predicate when you wish to test whether two numbers are equivalent.</li>
<li>Use the <code>eqv?</code> predicate when you wish to test whether two non-numeric values are equivalent.</li>
<li>Use the <code>equal?</code> predicate when you wish to test whether two lists, vectors, etc. are equivalent.</li>
<li>Dont use the <code>eq?</code> predicate unless you know exactly what youre doing.</li>
</ol>","<p>There are a full two pages in the RnRS specification related to <code>eq?, eqv?, equal? and =</code>.  Here is the <a href=http://www.larcenists.org/Documentation/Documentation0.98/r7rs.pdf rel=nofollow noreferrer>Draft R7RS Specification</a>.  Check it out!</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>=</code> compares numbers, 2.5 and 2.5 are numerically equal.</li>
<li><code>equal?</code> for numbers reduces to <code>=</code>, 2.5 and 2.5 are numerically equal.</li>
<li><code>eq?</code> compares pointers.  The number 5, in your Scheme implementation, is implemented as an immediate (likely), thus 5 and 5 are identical.  The number 2.5 may require an allocation of a floating point record in your Scheme implementation, the two pointers are not identical.</li>
</ul>","<p><strong><code>eq?</code></strong> is <code>#t</code> when it is the same address/object. <strong>Normally one could expect #t for same symbol, boolean and object and #f for values that is of different type, with different values, or not the same structure</strong> Scheme/Lisp-implementations has a tradition to embed type in their pointers and to embed values in the same space if its enough space. Thus  some pointers really are not addresses but values, like the char <code>R</code> or the Fixnum <code>10</code>. These will be <code>eq?</code> since the address is an embedded type+value. Some implementations also reuse immutable constants. (eq? (1 2 3) (1 2 3)) might be #f when interpreted but #t when compiled since it might get the same address. (Like the constant String pool in Java). Because of this, many expresions involving <code>eq?</code> are unspecified, thus wether it evaluates to #t or #f is implementation dependent. </p>
<p><strong><code>eqv?</code> are #t for the same things as <code>eq?</code>. It is also #t if its a number or character and its value is the same</strong>, even when the data is too big to fit into a pointer. Thus for those <code>eqv?</code> does the extra work of checking that type is one of the supported, that both are the same type and its target objects have the same data value. </p>
<p><strong><code>equal?</code></strong> is #t for the same things as <code>eqv?</code> and if its a compound type like pair, vector,
string, and bytevector it recursively does <code>equal?</code> with the parts. <strong>In practice it will return #t if the two objects looks the same</strong>. Prior to R6RS, its unsafe to use <code>equal?</code> on circular structures.</p>
<p><strong><code>=</code></strong> is like <code>eqv?</code> but <strong>it only works for numeric types</strong>. It might be more efficient.</p>
<p><strong><code>string=?</code></strong> is like <code>equal?</code>, but <strong>it only works for strings.</strong> It might be more efficient.</p>"

The server response was: 5.7.1 Unable to relay Error,"<p>The default configuration of most SMTP servers is not to relay from an untrusted source to outside domains. For example, imagine that you contact the SMTP server for foo.com and ask it to send a message to bar@xyzzy.com. Because the SMTP server doesnt really know who you are, it will refuse to relay the message.

<p>If you contact the foo.com mail server and ask it to send mail to somebody@foo.com, it <em>might</em> let you do it. It depends on if they trust that youre who you say you are. Often, the server will try to do a reverse DNS lookup, and refuse to send mail if the IP youre sending from doesnt match the IP address of the MX record in DNS. So if you say that youre the bar.com mail server but your IP address doesnt match the MX record for bar.com, then it will refuse to deliver the message.</p>
<p>Youll need to talk to the administrator of that SMTP server to get the authentication information so that it will allow relay for you.

for (var i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {
    console.log(list[i].id); //second console output
}
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Explanation For Why You Should Not Use <code>for/in</code></strong></p>
<p><code>for/in</code> is meant for iterating the properties of an object.  That means it will return all iterable properties of an object.  While it may appear to work for an array (returning array elements or pseudo-array elements), it can also return other properties of the object that are not what you are expecting from the array-like elements.  And, guess what, an <code>HTMLCollection</code> or <code>nodeList</code> object can both have other properties that will be returned with a <code>for/in</code> iteration.  I just tried this in Chrome and iterating it the way you were iterating it will retrieve the items in the list (indexes 0, 1, 2, etc...), but also will retrieve the <code>length</code> and <code>item</code> properties.  The <code>for/in</code> iteration simply wont work for an HTMLCollection.</p>
<hr/>
<p>See <a href=http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/FzZ2H/ rel=noreferrer>http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/FzZ2H/</a> for why you cant iterate an HTMLCollection with <code>for/in</code>.</p>
<p>In Firefox, your <code>for/in</code> iteration would return these items (all the iterable properties of the object):</p>
<pre><code>0
1
2
item
namedItem
@@iterator
length
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully, now you can see why you want to use <code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++)</code> instead so you just get <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> in your iteration.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Evolution of Browser Support for NodeList and HTMLCollection iteration</strong></p>
<p>Following below is an evolution of how browsers have evolved through the time period 2015-2018 giving you additional ways to iterate.  None of these are now needed in modern browsers since you can use the options described above.</p>
<p><strong>Update for ES6 in 2015</strong></p>
<p>Added to ES6 is <code>Array.from()</code> that will convert an array-like structure to an actual array.  That allows one to enumerate a list directly like this:</p>
<pre><code>use strict;

Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName(events)).forEach(function(item) {
   console.log(item.id);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Working demo (in Firefox, Chrome, and Edge as of April 2016): <a href=https://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/8ar4xn2s/ rel=noreferrer>https://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/8ar4xn2s/</a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update for ES6 in 2016</strong></p>
<p>You can now use the ES6 for/of construct with a <code>NodeList</code> and an <code>HTMLCollection</code> by just adding this to your code:</p>
<pre><code>NodeList.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator];
HTMLCollection.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator];
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>var list = document.getElementsByClassName(events);
for (var item of list) {
    console.log(item.id);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works in the current version of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.  This works because it attaches the Array iterator to both the NodeList and HTMLCollection prototypes so that when for/of iterates them, it uses the Array iterator to iterate them.</p>
<p>Working demo: <a href=http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/joy06u4e/ rel=noreferrer>http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/joy06u4e/</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Second Update for ES6 in Dec 2016</strong></p>
<p>As of Dec 2016, <code>Symbol.iterator</code> support has been built-in to Chrome v54 and Firefox v50 so the code below works by itself.  It is not yet built-in for Edge.</p>
<pre><code>var list = document.getElementsByClassName(events);
for (let item of list) {
    console.log(item.id);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Working demo (in Chrome and Firefox): <a href=http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/3ddpz8sp/ rel=noreferrer>http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/3ddpz8sp/</a></p>
<p><strong>Third Update for ES6 in Dec 2017</strong></p>
<p>As of Dec. 2017, this capability works in Edge 41.16299.15.0 for a <code>nodeList</code> as in <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code>, but not an <code>HTMLCollection</code> as in <code>document.getElementsByClassName()</code> so you have to manually assign the iterator to use it in Edge for an <code>HTMLCollection</code>.  It is a total mystery why theyd fix one collection type, but not the other.  But, you can at least use the result of <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> with ES6 <code>for/of</code> syntax in current versions of Edge now.</p>
<p>Ive also updated the above jsFiddle so it tests both <code>HTMLCollection</code> and <code>nodeList</code> separately and captures the output in the jsFiddle itself.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Update for ES6 in Mar 2018</strong></p>
<p>Per mesqueeeb, <code>Symbol.iterator</code> support has been built-in to Safari too, so you can use <code>for (let item of list)</code> for either <code>document.getElementsByClassName()</code> or <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth Update for ES6 in Apr 2018</strong></p>
<p>Apparently, support for iterating an <code>HTMLCollection</code> with <code>for/of</code> will be coming to Edge 18 in Fall 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Sixth Update for ES6 in Nov 2018</strong></p>
<p>I can confirm that with Microsoft Edge v18 (that is included in the Fall 2018 Windows Update), you can now iterate both an HTMLCollection and a NodeList with for/of in Edge.</p>
<p>So, now all modern browsers contain native support for <code>for/of</code> iteration of both the HTMLCollection and NodeList objects.</p>","<p>You cant use <code>for</code>/<code>in</code> on <code>NodeList</code>s or <code>HTMLCollection</code>s. However, you can use some <code>Array.prototype</code> methods, as long as you <code>.call()</code> them and pass in the <code>NodeList</code> or <code>HTMLCollection</code> as <code>this</code>.</p>
<p>So consider the following as an alternative to <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/22754453/414220>jfriend00s <code>for</code> loop</a>:</p>
<pre><code>var list= document.getElementsByClassName(events);
[].forEach.call(list, function(el) {
    console.log(el.id);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Theres a good <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList#Why_cant_I_use_forEach_or_map_on_a_NodeList.3F rel=noreferrer>article on MDN</a> that covers this technique. Note their warning about browser compatibility though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] passing a host object (like a <code>NodeList</code>) as
  <code>this</code> to a native method (such as <code>forEach</code>) is not guaranteed to work in
  all browsers and is known to fail in some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while this approach is convenient, a <code>for</code> loop may be the most browser-compatible solution.</p>
<p><strong>Update (Aug 30, 2014):</strong> Eventually youll be able to use <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of rel=noreferrer>ES6 <code>for</code>/<code>of</code></a>!</p>
<pre><code>var list = document.getElementsByClassName(events);
for (const el of list)
  console.log(el.id);
</code></pre>
<p>Its already supported in recent versions of Chrome and Firefox.</p>","<p>In ES6, you could do something like <code>[...collection]</code>, or <code>Array.from(collection)</code>,</p>
<pre><code>let someCollection = document.querySelectorAll(someSelector)
[...someCollection].forEach(someFn) 
//or
Array.from(collection).forEach(someFn)
</code></pre>
<p>Eg:-</p>
<pre><code>    navDoms = document.getElementsByClassName(nav-container);
    Array.from(navDoms).forEach(function(navDom){
     //implement function operations

<p>Same concept as a <code>.jar</code> file in Java, it is a <code>.zip</code> file with some metadata files renamed <code>.egg</code>, for distributing code as bundles.</p>
<p><a href=http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/setuptools/doc/formats.txt rel=noreferrer>Specifically: The Internal Structure of Python Eggs</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Python egg is a logical structure embodying the release of a
  specific version of a Python project, comprising its code, resources,
  and metadata. There are multiple formats that can be used to
  physically encode a Python egg, and others can be developed. However,
  a key principle of Python eggs is that they should be discoverable and
  importable. That is, it should be possible for a Python application to
  easily and efficiently find out what eggs are present on a system, and
  to ensure that the desired eggs contents are importable.</p>
<p>The <code>.egg</code> format is well-suited to distribution and the easy
  uninstallation or upgrades of code, since the project is essentially
  self-contained within a single directory or file, unmingled with any
  other projects code or resources.  It also makes it possible to have
  multiple versions of a project simultaneously installed, such that
  individual programs can select the versions they wish to use.</p>
</blockquote>","<p>The <code>.egg</code> file is a distribution format for Python packages. It’s just an alternative to a source code distribution or Windows <code>exe</code>. But note that for pure <code>Python</code>, the <code>.egg</code> file is completely cross-platform.</p>
<p>The <code>.egg</code> file itself is essentially a <code>.zip</code> file. If you change the extension to “<code>zip</code>”, you can see that it will have folders inside the archive.</p>
<p>Also, if you have an <code>.egg</code> file, you can install it as a package using <code>easy_install</code></p>
<p>Example:
To create an <code>.egg</code> file for a directory say <code>mymath</code> which itself may have several python scripts, do the following step:</p>
<pre><code># setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
setup(
    name = mymath,
    version = 0.1,
    packages = find_packages()
    )
</code></pre>
<p>Then, from the terminal do:</p>
<pre><code> $ python setup.py bdist_egg
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate lot of outputs, but when it’s completed you’ll see that you have <em>three</em> new folders: <em>build</em>, <em>dist</em>, and <em>mymath.egg-info</em>. The only folder that we care about is the <em>dist</em> folder where youll find your <code>.egg</code> file, <strong><code>mymath-0.1-py3.5.egg</code></strong> with your default python (installation) version number(mine here: 3.5)</p>
<p>Source: <a href=http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/ rel=noreferrer>Python library blog</a></p>","<p>Egg is a single-file importable distribution format for Python-related projects.</p>

Youre trying to test the wrapper component generated by calling <code>connect()(MyPlainComponent)</code>.  That wrapper component expects to have access to a Redux store.  Normally that store is available as <code>context.store</code>, because at the top of your component hierarchy youd have a <code>&lt;Provider store={myStore} /&gt;</code>.  However, youre rendering your connected component by itself, with no store, so its throwing an error.</p>
<p>Youve got a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a store and render a <code>&lt;Provider&gt;</code> around your connected component</li>
<li>Create a store and directly pass it in as <code>&lt;MyConnectedComponent store={store} /&gt;</code> , as the connected component will also accept store as a prop</li>
<li>Dont bother testing the connected component.  Export the plain, unconnected version, and test that instead.  If you test your plain component and your <code>mapStateToProps</code> function, you can safely assume the connected version will work correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably want to read through the Testing page in the Redux docs: <a href=https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests rel=noreferrer>https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests</a>. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>:</p>
<p>After actually seeing that you posted source, and re-reading the error message, the real problem is not with the SportsTopPane component.  The problem is that youre trying to fully render SportsTopPane, which also renders all of its children, rather than doing a shallow render like you were in the first case.  The line <code>searchComponent = &lt;SportsDatabase sportsWholeFramework=desktop /&gt;;</code> is rendering a component that I assume is also connected, and therefore expects a store to be available in Reacts context feature.</p>
<p>At this point, you have two new options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only do shallow rendering of SportsTopPane, so that youre not forcing it to fully render its children</li>
<li>If you do want to do deep rendering of SportsTopPane, youll need to provide a Redux store in context.  I highly suggest you take a look at the Enzyme testing library, which lets you do exactly that.  See <a href=http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/setContext.html rel=noreferrer>http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/setContext.html</a> for an example.</li>
</ul>

export class App extends Component { /* ... */ }
 
// Use default export for the connected component (for app)
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)

<p>Since the default export is still the decorated component, the import statement pictured above will work as before so you wont have to change your application code. However, you can now import the undecorated App components in your test file like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Note the curly braces: grab the named export instead of default export
import { App } from ./App
</code></pre>
<p>And if you need both:</p>
<pre><code>import ConnectedApp, { App } from ./App

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35003008/access-private-variables-from-class-in-c,function - Access private variables from class in C++,"<p>A very unpopular option is to use setters and getters.</p>
<pre><code>class A {
  public:

    int get_life() const { return life_; }
    std::string get_greeting() const { return greeting_; }
  private:
    int life_;
    std::string greeting_;

<p>These would be used in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>int main() {
  A a;
  a.set_life(42); // My objects life_ variable is now 42.
  a.set_greeting(Hello, World!); // My objects greeting_ variable is now Hello, World!.

  std::cout &lt;&lt; a.get_greeting() &lt;&lt;  The meaning of life is  &lt;&lt; a.get_life() &lt;&lt; \n;
  // Hello World! The meaning of life is 42
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is considered a faux-pas because if you introduce getters and setters as a rule for every private variable, you might as well make the variables public - they can be changed anyway.</p>
<p>A better practice is to use your constructor to set your variables initially and create a method to do what you need with your variables - the programmer shouldnt need to know about them (hence private).</p>
<pre><code>class A {
  public:
    // Construct life_ with life and greeting_ with greeting
    A(int life, std::string greeting) : life_(life), greeting_(greeting) {}
    void print_message() const {

    }
  private:
    int life_;
    std::string greeting_;
};   
</code></pre>
<p>and now your main would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>int main() {
  A a(42, Hello, World!);
  a.print_message();
}
</code></pre>","<p>Of course, understanding how to interact with a classs <code>private</code>s implies grokking the point of <code>private</code>, <code>class</code>, and all, summarized in one term as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29 rel=nofollow><strong>encapsulation</strong>,</a> a major property provided by OOP.</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming is about objects interacting with each other over interfaces. These interfaces supply users with altering the objects state. In a 3D-context, for example, a cube can be rotated, the coordinates of one of its vertices can be retrieved, etc.<br/>
Why interfaces? To hide implementation details. Internal variables (<code>private</code> variables) are not supposed to be visible to any user of the object. OTOH, there are exposed variables (marked <code>public</code>), which depict that interface I was talking about.<br/>
For completenesss sake, Ill mention <code>protected</code>, which shares its subordinate variables with derived classes, but thats beside the point of this question, IMO.<br/>
But why hide implementation details? To make users independent of the internal structure and state of an object. Any changes there are invisible to users, which improves maintainability, code readability, and code reusability.</p>
<p>So, how to proceed any further? You need to think about how the <code>Equation</code> class will be used and its internal state and its exposures. An equation consists of a multitude of variables. They should be the internal state. Its got two sides (maybe more). You need some way to represent them. Operations on equations: solving them? Performing equivalency transformations? Printing them out? Thats what you have to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> others have mentioned setters and getters. They are used to set and get member variables of an object, respectively. Its bad because they break encapsulation; they change the state of the object directly, defeating the purpose of OOP except when trying to make mutable member variables appear constant or controlling the modification of variables with customized code, for example.</p>","<p>As Paul mentioned, if you are making the variables private inside a the Equation class, then you would not want any entity other than the Equation class to have access to those variables. </p>
<p>In this case, you should solve for x and y using private members of the class (since class members can access private variables of the class), and provide a public interface to access the results of solving the system.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;utility&gt;  // For std::pair

class EquationSolver {
public: 
  EquationSolver(int _a, int _b, int _c, int _d, int _e, int _f)
  : a(_a), b(_b), c(_c), d(_d), e(_e), f(_f), x(0.0), y(0.0) {}

  // This is the interface for solving the equations via method a
  // And allows outside entities to get the result of solving the system
  std::pair&lt;double, double&gt; solveViaMethodA() {
    solveForXInternally();  // This solves for X via the private implementation below
    solveForYInternally();  // This solves for Y via the private implementation below

    // x and y have been updated internally, so they can be returned as the result of the solved system
    return std::make_pair(x, y);
  }
private:
  int a, b, c, d, e, f;
  double x, y;

  // This is an implementation for solving for x 
  void solveForXInternally() {
    x = ((c*e)-(b*f))/ ((a*e)-(b*d));
  }
  // This is an implementation for solving for y 
  void solveForYInternally() {
    y = ((a*f)-(c*d))/ ((a*e)-(b*d));
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can use this class to solve equations as follows:</p>
<pre><code>int main() {
  // Create an instance of the EquationSolver class
  EquationSolver solver(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

  // Use the instance of the solver to solve the equations
  std::pair&lt;double, double&gt; solved_variables = solver. solveViaMethodA();
}
</code></pre>
<p>While this example illustrates using a class to store the coefficients required for solving the equation, it is not necessary for solving a single equation. A far more concise solution would be to use a single function, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;utility&gt;

std::pair&lt;double, double&gt; solveSystem(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
  double x = ((c*e)-(b*f))/ ((a*e)-(b*d));  
  double y = ((a*f)-(c*d))/ ((a*e)-(b*d));
  return std::make_pair(x, y);
};

int main() {
  std::pair&lt;double, double&gt; solved_variables = solveSystem(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
}
</code></pre>
<p>What using a class does allow, however, is for the solution to be easily extended. For example, in the EquationSolver class I provided, if you wanted to solve the equations differently then you could implement additional private member functions to solve for x and y internally, and add another public member function to access the solution via the alternate method.</p>"

<p>tlog files are created by the Tracker.exe process which runs while you do a build, and records some information about the build.</p>
<p>That information is used and updated the next time you start a build to help detect out of date files, and thus enable the build system to only build the bits that need to be rebuilt (rather than building everything again).</p>

</ul>
<h2>What causes the out of date problem?</h2>
<p>The problem can be caused by incorrect or stale information in the <code>*.tlog</code> files.</p>
<p>There are 3 main ways that can happen:</p>
<p>1) You built a project on your hard disk, and then moved the directory to another location...the tlog files recorded the paths of the old location, yet because you moved the files, they are no longer there, thus you get out of date.</p>
<p>2) Your Project has references to files (usually header files), which do not exist at the location specified. This might occur if you deleted a file from your source control system, but forgot to remove it from your project, or because you refer to header files of a library which might be installed/present at a different location. Often, Developers assume files are located at the same place on everyones machine....not always the case!</p>
<p>3) You have done some refactoring of your project, and moved files around to different subdirectories, or even renamed them - so the paths/names of the files recorded in the tlog do not match what exists on your disk i.e. stale.</p>
<h2>What is the way to fix it?</h2>
<p>Doing a Clean+Build or Rebuild does not always fix it...as those operations do not delete the tlog files. So:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>delete any tlog files that you can find in your solution/project directories and rebuild.</p></li>
<li><p>make sure your Project does not refer to non-existent files</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I work out which files are non-existent?</h2>
<p>If you want to know/find out exactly which files Visual Studio is thinking are out of date, then you can turn on some diagnostic information in Visual Studio....and watch the messages in DebugView...showing the full path of the files it is probing.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsproject/archive/2009/07/21/enable-c-project-system-logging.aspx rel=noreferrer>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsproject/archive/2009/07/21/enable-c-project-system-logging.aspx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>devenv.exe.config</code> you put:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;system.diagnostics&gt;
      &lt;switches&gt;
        &lt;add name=CPS value=4 /&gt;
      &lt;/switches&gt;
    &lt;/system.diagnostics&gt; 
</code></pre>
<h2>More Details</h2>
<p>Lets say you created a Solution and a set of Projects in a particular directory e.g. S:\MYPROJECTS, and you compile and run/debug it, etc.</p>
<p>You then decide to move that whole directory to somewhere else on your drive, or you re-factor your Projects e.g. change their directory names, etc.</p>
<p>Now when you do a Start Debugging/F5, Visual Studio does the depending checking, and thinks you have out of date files.</p>
<p>Even if you do a Clean Solution, or a Rebuild Solution....you still get the out of date files message.</p>
<p>See here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/653355/suggestion-help-me-diagnose-issues-causing-this-project-is-out-of-date-message rel=noreferrer>http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/653355/suggestion-help-me-diagnose-issues-causing-this-project-is-out-of-date-message</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is caused by the .tlog files which are being consulted during the dependency checks...when you moved the solutions/projects (along with a builds intermediate files) they cause confusion to the Visual Studio builder.</p>
<p>The solution is to delete all the .tlog files.....they will then be re-generated the next time you do a build...and from that point on you wont get a bogus out of date files message....unless they truly are out of date.</p>","<p>You should let Visual Studio tell you why it needs to rebuild. <strong>Visual Studio 2015</strong> has built in support for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools (menu)</li>
<li>Options</li>
<li>Project and Solution</li>
<li>Build and Run</li>
</ul>
<p>Change MSBuild project build output verbosity to <strong>Detailed</strong> or Diagnostics.</p>
<p>In my case it printed a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>1&gt;------ Up-To-Date check: Project: xyz, Configuration: xyz ------
1&gt;Project not up to date because build input C:\ws\Missing.h is missing.
</code></pre>
<p>... and removing that header from the project fixed the problem.</p>
<p><em>To get this information in older Visual Studio versions, you need to use DebugView and modify <code>devenv.exe.config</code> (see Colin Smiths answer: <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/21759835/1941779>https://stackoverflow.com/a/21759835/1941779</a>). Note that this solution does NOT work for Visual Studio 2015.</em></p>","<p>I too kept getting The project out-of-date error, even though there were no changes.

<li><p>You should not be updating 10k rows in a set unless you are certain that the operation is getting Page Locks (due to multiple rows per page being part of the <code>UPDATE</code> operation). The issue is that Lock Escalation (from either Row or Page to Table locks) occurs at 5000 <em>locks</em>. So it is safest to keep it just below 5000, just in case the operation is using Row Locks.</p>

<li><p>There is no purpose in having an explicit transaction here. It complicates the code and you have no handling for a <code>ROLLBACK</code>, which isnt even needed since each statement is its own transaction (i.e. auto-commit).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming you find a reason to keep the explicit transaction, then you do not have a <code>TRY</code> / <code>CATCH</code> structure. Please see my answer on DBA.StackExchange for a <code>TRY</code> / <code>CATCH</code> template that handles transactions:</p>

<p>I suspect that the real <code>WHERE</code> clause is not being shown in the example code in the Question, so simply relying upon what has been shown, a <em>better</em> model <sup>(please see note below regarding performance)</sup> would be:</p>
<pre class=lang-sql prettyprint-override><code>DECLARE @Rows INT,
        @BatchSize INT; -- keep below 5000 to be safe
    
SET @BatchSize = 2000;

SET @Rows = @BatchSize; -- initialize just to enter the loop

BEGIN TRY    
  WHILE (@Rows = @BatchSize)
  BEGIN
      UPDATE TOP (@BatchSize) tab
      SET    tab.Value = abc1
      FROM  TableName tab
      WHERE tab.Parameter1 = abc
      AND   tab.Parameter2 = 123
      AND   tab.Value &lt;&gt; abc1 COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN2;
      -- Use a binary Collation (ending in _BIN2, not _BIN) to make sure
      -- that you dont skip differences that compare the same due to
      -- insensitivity of case, accent, etc, or linguistic equivalence.

      SET @Rows = @@ROWCOUNT;
  END;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
  RAISERROR(stuff);
  RETURN;
END CATCH;
</code></pre>
<p>By testing <code>@Rows</code> against <code>@BatchSize</code>, you can avoid that final <code>UPDATE</code> query (in most cases) because the final set is typically some number of rows less than <code>@BatchSize</code>, in which case we know that there are no more to process (which is what you see in the output shown in your <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/35919286/577765>answer</a>). Only in those cases where the final set of rows is equal to <code>@BatchSize</code> will this code run a final <code>UPDATE</code> affecting 0 rows.</p>
<p>I also added a condition to the <code>WHERE</code> clause to prevent rows that have already been updated from being updated again.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE REGARDING PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>I emphasized better above (as in, this is a <em>better</em> model) because this has several improvements over the O.P.s original code, and works fine in many cases, but is not perfect for all cases. For tables of at least a certain size (which varies due to several factors so I cant be more specific), performance will degrade as there are fewer rows to fix if either:</p>
<ol>
<li>there is no index to support the query, or</li>
<li>there is an index, but at least one column in the <code>WHERE</code> clause is a string data type that does not use a binary collation, hence a <code>COLLATE</code> clause is added to the query here to force the binary collation, and doing so invalidates the index (for this particular query).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the situation that @mikesigs encountered, thus requiring a different approach. The updated method copies the IDs for all rows to be updated into a temporary table, then uses that temp table to <code>INNER JOIN</code> to the table being updated on the clustered index key column(s). (Its important to capture and join on the <em>clustered index</em> columns, whether or not those are the primary key columns!).</p>
<p>Please see <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/66792237/577765>@mikesigs answer</a> below for details. The approach shown in that answer is a very effective pattern that I have used myself on many occasions. The only changes I would make are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explicitly create the <code>#targetIds</code> table rather than using <code>SELECT INTO...</code></li>
<li>For the <code>#targetIds</code> table, declare a clustered primary key on the column(s).</li>
<li>For the <code>#batchIds</code> table, declare a clustered primary key on the column(s).</li>
<li>For inserting into <code>#targetIds</code>, use <code>INSERT INTO #targetIds (column_name(s)) SELECT</code> <em>and</em> remove the <code>ORDER BY</code> as its unnecessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if you dont have an index that can be used for this operation, and cant temporarily create one that will actually work (a filtered index might work, depending on your <code>WHERE</code> clause for the <code>UPDATE</code> query), then try the approach shown in <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/66792237/577765>@mikesigs answer</a> (and if you use that solution, please up-vote it).</p>","<pre><code>WHILE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM TableName WHERE Value &lt;&gt; abc1 AND Parameter1 = abc AND Parameter2 = 123)
BEGIN
UPDATE TOP (1000) TableName
SET Value = abc1
WHERE Parameter1 = abc AND Parameter2 = 123 AND Value &lt;&gt; abc1
END
</code></pre>","<p>I encountered this thread yesterday and wrote a script based on the accepted answer. It turned out to perform very slowly, taking 12 hours to process 25M of 33M rows. I wound up cancelling it this morning and working with a DBA to improve it.</p>
<p>The DBA pointed out that the <code>is null</code> check in my UPDATE query was using a Clustered Index <em>Scan</em> on the PK, and it was the scan that was slowing the query down. Basically, the longer the query runs, the further it needs to look through the index for the right rows.</p>
<p>The approach he came up with was obvious in hind sight. Essentially, you load the IDs of the rows you want to update into a temp table, then join that onto the target table in the update statement. This uses an Index <em>Seek</em> instead of a Scan. And ho boy does it speed things up! It took 2 minutes to update the last 8M records.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21896580/convert-float-to-int,c# - Convert Float to Int,"<p>Firstly, there are <em>integers</em> and <em>floating-point</em> numbers. Integers are <em>always</em> whole numbers, such as <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>-32</code>, <code>42</code> and <code>1337</code>. On the other hand, floating-point numbers <em>can</em> have a fractional part: <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>-32.1</code>, <code>42.7</code> and <code>123.456788</code> are all valid floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>When converting between integers (<code>int</code>) and floating-point (<code>float</code>) numbers, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>int someInt = 42;
float someFloat = someInt;  // 42.0f
</code></pre>
<p>But you cant do this:</p>
<pre><code>float someFloat = 42.7f;
int someInt = someFloat;    // ?
</code></pre>
<p>The reason the first conversion is possible, is that converting the integer number (<code>int</code>) to a floating-point number (<code>float</code>) does <em>not</em> change the number. It is a safe conversion, and therefore can be done <em>implicitly</em>.</p>
<p>The reason the second conversion is not allowed, is that converting the floating-point number (which may have a fractional part) to an integer number (that never has a fractional part) must drop the fractional part of the number, i.e. it becomes a different number. This is not safe, and can therefore only be done <em>explicitly</em>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>To explicitly convert one type of number to another, you use a <em>cast</em>. Thats the parentheses before the number with the type of the number that you want to convert it to.</p>
<pre><code>float someFloat = 42.7f;
int someInt = (int)someFloat;               // 42
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the fractional part of the floating-point number was dropped. Its as if it has been rounded towards zero. If you want to round the floating-point number to the nearest whole number, use the <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.round.aspx rel=noreferrer><code>Math.Round</code> method</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git reflog

b710729 HEAD@{0}: rebase: some commit
5ad7c1c HEAD@{1}: rebase: another commit
deafcbf HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from master to my-branch
...

$ git reset HEAD@{2} --hard

<p>Now you should be back to before the rebase started.</p>
<p>To find the right place to reset to, you just pick the entry closest to the top that <strong>doesnt</strong> start with rebase.</p>
<p>Update: As mentioned in comments and other answers, you can also use <code>ORIG_HEAD</code> as an easier way to find where to reset to: <code>git reset ORIG_HEAD --hard</code></p>
<h3>Alternative approach</h3>
<p>If the rebase is the <strong>only thing</strong> you have done on the branch, i.e. you have no unpushed commits/changes - then you could just delete the local branch with <code>git branch -D</code> and then check it out again:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout my-branch
$ git rebase master
// not happy with the result
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -D my-branch
$ git checkout my-branch
</code></pre>
<p>Or for the same effect, you could reset --hard to the origin branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ git reset --hard origin/my-branch
</code></pre>
<p>If you did do this while you had other unpushed commits, then you will have lost them. In that case, just use the reflog approach above to jump back to the reflog entry where you made the commit(s).</p>","<p>Rebase keeps a backup of the old state as <code>ORIG_HEAD</code>.<br/>
So you can revert the last rebase by running:</p>

</code></pre>","<p>I agree with the answer/solution from Chip Uni. I will just comment the sorting part and provide some further explanations:</p>
<p>You do not need any sorting algorithm. The algorithm is similar to quicksort, with the difference that only one partition is solved (left or right). We just need to find an optimal pivot so that left and right parts are as equal as possible, which would mean N/2 + N/4 + N/8 ... = 2N iterations, and thus the time complexity of O(N). The above algorithms, called median of medians, computes the median of medians of 5, which turns out to yield linear time complexity of the algorithm.</p>
<p>However, sorting algorithm is used when the range being searched for nth smallest/greatest element (which I suppose you are implementing with this algorithm) in order to speed up the algorithm. Insertion sort is particularly fast on small arrays up to 7 to 10 elements.</p>
<p>Implementation note:</p>
<pre><code>M = select({x[i]}, n/10)
</code></pre>
<p>actually means taking the median of all those medians of 5-element groups. You can accomplish that by creating another array of size <code>(n - 1)/5 + 1</code> and call the same algorithm recursively to find the n/10-th element (which is median of the newly created array).</p>"

<p>Detailed explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>\w</code> is any digit, letter, or underscore.</li>
<li><code>\s</code> is any whitespace.</li>
<li><code>[^\w\s]</code> is anything thats not a digit, letter, whitespace, or underscore.</li>

</ol>","<p>Here are the standard punctuation characters for US-ASCII: <code>!#$%&amp;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~</code></p>
<p>For Unicode punctuation (such as curly quotes, em-dashes, etc), you can easily match on specific block ranges. The <strong>General Punctuation</strong> block is <code>\u2000-\u206F</code>, and the <strong>Supplemental Punctuation</strong> block is <code>\u2E00-\u2E7F</code>.</p>
<p>Put together, and properly escaped, you get the following RegExp:</p>

var spaceRE = /\s+/g;
var str = This, -/ is #! an $ % ^ &amp; * example ;: {} of a = -_ string with `~)() punctuation;
str.replace(punctRE, ).replace(spaceRE,  );

<p>Here is all the relevant code:</p>
<p>1) app.config.ts</p>
<pre><code>import { OpaqueToken } from @angular/core;

export let APP_CONFIG = new OpaqueToken(app.config);

export interface IAppConfig {
    apiEndpoint: string;
}

export const AppConfig: IAppConfig = {    
    apiEndpoint: http://localhost:15422/api/    
};
</code></pre>
<p>2) app.module.ts</p>
<pre><code>import { APP_CONFIG, AppConfig } from ./app.config;

@NgModule({
    providers: [
        { provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: AppConfig }

}
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can inject the config everywhere without using the string names and with the use of your interface for static checks.</p>
<p>You can of course separate the Interface and the constant further to be able to supply different values in production and development e.g.</p>","<h2>Updated for Angular 4+</h2>
<p>Now we can simply use environments file which angular provide default if your project is generated via angular-cli.</p>
<p>for example </p>
<p>In your environments folder create following files </p>
<ul>
<li><code>environment.prod.ts</code></li>
<li><code>environment.qa.ts</code></li>
<li><code>environment.dev.ts</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and each file can hold related code changes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>environment.prod.ts</code></p>
<pre><code>export const environment = {
     production: true,
     apiHost: https://api.somedomain.com/prod/v1/,
     CONSUMER_KEY: someReallyStupidTextWhichWeHumansCantRead, 
     codes: [ AB, AC, XYZ ],
};
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>environment.qa.ts</code></p>
<pre><code>export const environment = {
     production: false,
     apiHost: https://api.somedomain.com/qa/v1/,
     CONSUMER_KEY : someReallyStupidTextWhichWeHumansCantRead, 
     codes: [ AB, AC, XYZ ],
};
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>environment.dev.ts</code></p>
<pre><code>export const environment = {
     production: false,
     apiHost: https://api.somedomain.com/dev/v1/,
     CONSUMER_KEY : someReallyStupidTextWhichWeHumansCantRead, 
     codes: [ AB, AC, XYZ ],
};
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3>Use-case in application</h3>
<p>You can import environments into any file such as services  <code>clientUtilServices.ts</code> </p>
<p><code>import {environment} from ../../environments/environment;</code></p>
<pre><code>getHostURL(): string {
    return environment.apiHost;
  }
</code></pre>
<h3>Use-case in build</h3>
<p>Open your angular cli file <code>.angular-cli.json</code> and inside <code>apps: [{...}]</code> add following code </p>
<pre><code> apps:[{
        environments: {
            dev: environments/environment.ts,
            prod: environments/environment.prod.ts,
            qa: environments/environment.qa.ts,
           }
         }
       ]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to build for production, run  <code>ng build --env=prod</code> it will read configuration from  <code>environment.prod.ts</code> , same way you can do it for <code>qa</code> or <code>dev</code></p>

<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnZMa.png rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnZMa.png/></a></p>
<p>The <em>Miscellaneous Files</em> message can happen for many reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It can happen when you open your Unity C# file from another folder instead of opening it from Unity Editor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This can also happen because Unity crashed while Visual Studio is still open therefore corrupting some files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can happen because Unity was closed then re-opened but is no longer connected to Visual Studio. When Visual Studio is opened you get <em>Miscellaneous Files</em> and no auto-completion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This can happen when <em>Visual Studio Tools for unity</em> is not installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you create a script from Unity then quickly open it before Unity finish processing it or before the round icon animation stuff finish animating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><em>Most of the times, restarting Unity and Visual Studio should fix this.</em></p>
<p>I cant tell which one is causing the problem but I will cover the most likely solution to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>Fix Part 1</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download and Install <em>Visual Studio Tools for unity</em> from <a href=https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SebastienLebreton.VisualStudio2015ToolsforUnity rel=noreferrer>this</a> link. Do this while Unity and Visual Studio are both closed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From Unity Editor, go to <em>Edit</em> → <em>Preferences</em>... → <em>External Tools</em>. On the <em>External Script Editor</em> drop down menu, change that to <em>Visual Studio 2015</em>.</p>
<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/I6mZ8.gif rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/I6mZ8.gif/></a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Fix Part 2</strong>:</p>
<p>If newly created C# files are coming up as <em>Miscellaneous</em> then follow the instruction below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>From Visual Studio, go to <em>Tools</em> → <em>Options...</em> → <em>Tools for Unity</em> → <em>Miscellaneous</em>. Under <em>Show connectivity icon</em>, set it to <code>true</code> then restart Visual Studio.</p>
<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/cQ5qZ.gif rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/cQ5qZ.gif/></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>When you re-start, connection icon should now be available in Visual Studio. Click it then choose the Unity instance to connect to. The red x icon should now turn into a brown checkmark icon. Now, when you create a new C# file in Unity, it should open without saying <em>Miscellaneous</em>.</p>
<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/gcTtT.gif rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/gcTtT.gif/></a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Fix Part 3</strong>:</p>
<p>Still not fixed?</p>
<p>Re-import project then open C# Project.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Close Visual Studio.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From Unity, re-import project by going to <em>Assets</em> → <em>Reimport All</em>.</p>
<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/cXz71.gif rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/cXz71.gif/></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, open the project in Visual Studio by going to <em>Assets</em> → <em>Open C# Project</em>. This will reload the project and fix possible solution file problems.</p>
<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/ymH26.gif rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/ymH26.gif/></a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Fix Part 4</strong>:</p>
<p>Still not fixed?</p>
<p>Fix each C# file individually.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click on <em>Show All Files</em> icon.</p>
<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/N9Up2.gif rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/N9Up2.gif/></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the script that doesnt do auto-complete then right-click and select <em>Include In Project</em>.</p>
<p><a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/ne57W.gif rel=noreferrer><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/ne57W.gif/></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Close Visual Studio</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go your project directory and delete all the generated Visual Studio files.</p>
<p>These are the files extensions to delete:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.csproj</code></li>
<li><code>.user</code></li>
<li><code>.sln</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Lets say that the name of your Project is called <code>Target_Shoot</code>, these are what the files to delete should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Target_Shoot.csproj</code></li>
<li><code>Target_Shoot.Editor.csproj</code></li>
<li><code>Target_Shoot.Editor.csproj.user</code></li>
<li><code>Target_Shoot.Player.csproj</code></li>
<li><code>Target_Shoot.Player.csproj.user</code></li>
<li><code>Target_Shoot.sln</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not delete anything else.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double click on the script again <strong>from Unity</strong> which should generate new Visual Studio file then open Visual Studio. This may solve your problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Fix Part 6</strong>:</p>
<p>If not working, check if you are having <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47797510/the-getreferencenearesttargetframeworktask-task-was-not-found>this</a> error:</p>

<li><p>In Unity Editor Go to Menu, Click on Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; External Tools -&gt; External Script Editor. Set it to Visual Studio (your installed version of VS).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now in Menubar go to Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Player Settings -&gt; Other Settings -&gt; Under Configuration -&gt; Check API Compatibility Level -&gt; Change it to your installed .Net version. In my case I set it to .Net 4.x</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now if Visual Studio is running already go to Visual Studio, it will ask to reload project. Reload the project. Check if it works, if not close Visual Studio. Now Open cs file from Unity Editor, and now it should work.</p>","<p>I found another way to fix this issue in a more convenient manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the broken file in Solution Explorer.</li>
<li>Open its Properties.</li>
<li>Switch field Build Action from Compile to None.</li>
<li>Then switch it back to Compile.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will kill the synchronization between Unity and Visual Studio somehow.</p>

<p>Most driver implementations (the Chrome driver and the IE driver for sure) create a HTTP server. The language bindings (Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, etc.) all use a JSON-over-HTTP protocol to communicate with the driver and automate the browser. Since the HTTP server is simply listening on an open port for HTTP requests generated by the language bindings, connections to the HTTP server started by the language bindings are only allowed to come from other processes on the same host. Note carefully that this limitation does not apply to connections the  <em>browser</em> can make to outside websites; rather it simply prevents <em>incoming</em> connections from other websites.</p>","<p>Not necessarily the best practice, but my environment was a local network with several machines which needed access to the selenium.  </p>
<p>When running the chromedriver, you can pass through a param like so :</p>
<p><code>chromedriver --whitelisted-ips=</code></p>
<p>This will basically whitelist all IPs, not always an ideal solution of course and be careful with it for production enviornments, but you should be presented with a verbose warning : </p>

</div>","<p><strong>Wait! Theres a reason for that ugly outline!</strong></p>
<p>Before removing that ugly blue outline, you may want to take <strong>accessibility</strong> into consideration. By default, that blue outline is placed on focusable elements. This is so that users with accessibility issues are able to focus that button by tabbing to it. Some users do not have the motor skills to use a mouse and must use only the keyboard (or some other input device) for computer interaction. When you remove the blue outline, there is no longer a visual indicator on what element is focused. If you are going to remove the blue outline, you <em>should</em> replace it with another type of visual indication that the button is focused.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Solution: Darken Buttons when focused</strong></p>
<p>For the examples below, Chromes blue outline was first removed by using <code>button:focus { outline:0 !important; }</code></p>
<p>Here are your basic Bootstrap buttons as they appear normally:
<img alt=Bootstrap Buttons in Normal State src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rj3Pu.png/></p>
<p>Here are the buttons when they receive focus:
<img alt=Bootstrap Buttons in Focused State src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/wb0vw.png/></p>
<p>Here the buttons when they are pressed:
<img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/jInZM.png/></p>
<p>As you can see, the buttons are a little darker when they receive focus. Personally, I would recommend making the focused buttons even darker so that there is a very noticeable difference between the focused state and the normal state of the button.</p>
<p><strong>Its not just for disabled users</strong></p>
<p>Making your site more accessible is something that is often overlooked but can help create a more productive experience in your website. There are many normal users that use keyboard commands to navigate through websites in order to keep hands on the keyboard.</p>","<p>I just remove the outline from all the tags in the page by selecting all and applying outline:none to everything:)</p>
<pre><code>*:focus {outline:none}

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47615751/docker-compose-run-a-script-after-container-has-started,"docker-compose, run a script after container has started?","<p>The trick is to overwrite the compose COMMAND to perform whatever init action you need before calling the original command.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a script in your image that will perform the init work that you want like set password, change internal config files, etc. Lets call it <code>init.sh</code>. You add it to your image.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code>FROM: sourceimage:tag
COPY init.sh /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT []
</code></pre>
<p>The above overrides whatever ENTRYPOINT is defined in the <code>sourceimage</code>. Thats to make this example simpler. Make sure you understand what the ENTRYPOINT is doing in the Dockerfile from the <code>sourceimage</code> and call it in the <code>command:</code> of the docker-compose.yml file.</p>
<p>docker-compose.yml:</p>
<pre><code>services:
  myservice:
    image: something:tag
    ...
    command: sh -c /usr/local/bin/init.sh &amp;&amp; exec myexecutable
</code></pre>
<p>Its important to use <code>exec</code> before calling the main command. That will install the command as the first process (PID1) which will make it receive signals like STOP, KILL (Ctrl-C on keyboard) or HUP.</p>","<p>This is the way I use for calling a script after a container is started without overriding the entrypoint.</p>
<p>In my example, I used it for initializing the replicaset of my local MongoDB</p>
<pre><code>services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4.2.8
    hostname: mongo
    container_name: mongodb
    entrypoint: [/usr/bin/mongod,--bind_ip_all,--replSet,rs0]
    ports:

  mongosetup:

      - mongo
    restart: no
    entrypoint: [ bash, -c, sleep 10 &amp;&amp; mongo --host mongo:27017 --eval rs.initiate()]      
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In the first part, I simply launch my service (mongo)</li>
<li>The second service use a bash entry point AND a <code>restart: no</code> &lt;= <strong>important</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I also use a <code>depends_on</code> between service and setup service for manage the launch order.</p>","<p>You can also use volumes to do this:</p>

    entrypoint: sh -c /init.sh

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23815952/prolog-arguments-are-not-sufficiently-instantiated,Prolog - Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated,"<p>I am writing this answer, because the best answer yet was in a <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23815952/prolog-arguments-are-not-sufficiently-instantiated#comment36639272_23815952>comment</a> by <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker>lurker</a>. I want to have it show up as an actual answer.</p>
<p>Your code is not working, because youre doing <code>R1 is R+1</code> when <code>R</code> isnt instantiated in the case <code>not_number([X|T], R)</code>. Your recursive case is strung a little backwards. You want to do this:</p>
<pre><code>not_number([X|T],R):- 
    not(number(X)),
    not_number(T,R1),
    R is R1+1.
</code></pre>
<p>Now the right side of the <code>is</code> is instantiated when it is called.</p>","<p>Your problem is that in arithmetic computation like this:</p>
<p>A is B</p>
<p>everything on the right side (B) has to be already known. No variables there.</p>
<p>You may do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>not_number(X, Y) :- not_number(X, Y, 0).
not_number([], Y, Y).
not_number([H|T], Y, Z) :-
    \+ (number(H)), 
    Z1 is Z+1,
    not_number(T, Y, Z1).

not_number([H|T], Y, Z) :-
    number(H),
    not_number(T, Y, Z).
</code></pre>
<p>(tested this code now, it works).</p>
<p>Now the third argument is an accumulator. It counts how many not-numbers there are. When the list is empty, this third argument is unified with the second one and it becomes the proper answer.</p>
<p>Prolog, when given the chance, will go through all the routes possible. If you do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat(adam).
cat(eve).
</code></pre>
<p>and then ask:</p>
<pre><code>?- cat(X).
</code></pre>
<p>You could get both answers: X = adam and X = eve.
It applies to your code too: notice that when the head of the list is not a number, you can still do this:</p>
<pre><code>not_number([_|Tail],Result):-
    not_number(Tail,Result).  
</code></pre>
<p>which gives not the answer you would like. You have to cut off the routes that dont interest you. In this case, I would add</p>
<pre><code>number(Head).
</code></pre>
<p>to ensure that we skip an element in a list without increasing the counter by 1 only when this element is not a number.</p>
<p>To enforce Prolog to find some other results, you must press ; on your keyboard (like in this adam and eve example).</p>","<p>The general solution to such problems is to use <strong>constraints</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, your program works exactly as expected if you just use <a class=post-tag href=/questions/tagged/clpfd rel=tag title=show questions tagged clpfd>clpfd</a> constraints. Simply replace <code>(is)/2</code> by <code>(#=)/2</code> to obtain integer arithmetic that works <em>in all directions</em>:</p>
<pre><code>:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

not_number([],0).
not_number([X|T],R):- 
    \+ number(X),
    R1 #= R+1,  
    not_number(T,R1). 

not_number([_|Tail],Result):-
    not_number(Tail,Result).
</code></pre>
<p>Sample query and its result:</p>
<pre>
?- not_number([1,2,3,5], R).
<b>R = 0.</b>
</pre>
<p>Note also that I have changed the code to use the ISO-predicate <code>(\+)/1</code> instead of <code>not/1</code>.</p>"

<h2>1. Download the cookie plugin</h2>
<p><code>$.cookie</code> is not a standard jQuery function and the plugin needs to be downloaded <a href=https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie rel=noreferrer>here</a>. Make sure to include the appropriate <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag where necessary (see next).</p>
<h2>2. Include jQuery before the cookie plugin</h2>
<p>When including the cookie script, make sure to include jQuery FIRST, then the cookie plugin. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=~/Scripts/jquery-2.0.3.js type=text/javascript&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=~/Scripts/jquery_cookie.js type=text/javascript&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>3. Dont include jQuery more than once</h2>
<p>This was my problem. Make sure you arent including jQuery more than once. If you are, it is possible that: </p>
<ol>
<li>jQuery loads correctly.</li>
<li>The cookie plugin loads correctly.</li>
<li>Your second inclusion of jQuery overwrites the first and destroys the cookie plugin.</li>
</ol>
<p>For anyone using ASP.Net MVC projects, be careful with the default javascript bundle inclusions. My second inclusion of jQuery was within one of my global layout pages under the line <code>@Scripts.Render(~/bundles/jquery)</code>.</p>
<h2>4. Rename the plugin file to not include .cookie</h2>
<p>In some rare cases, renaming the file to something that does NOT include .cookie has fixed this error, apparently due to web server issues. By default, the downloaded script is titled jquery.cookie.js but try renaming it to something like jquery_cookie.js as shown above.

<p>A CODEC is a COder/DECocer for audio and video streams.  Unless you can view the properties of a particular clip, you really dont know what CODEC the author used.</p>",<p>Make sure to encode your videos in H264.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62847331/is-there-possible-to-install-curl-into-busybox-in-kubernetes-pod,is there possible to install curl into busybox in kubernetes pod,"<p>The short answer, is you cannot.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Because busybox does not have package manager like: yum, apk, or apt-get ..</p>
<h3>Acutally you have two solutions:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Either use a modified busybox</strong></p>
<p>You can use other busybox images like <a href=https://github.com/progrium/busybox rel=noreferrer>progrium/busybox</a> which provides <strong>opkg-install</strong> as a package manager.</p>
<pre><code>image: progrium/busybox
</code></pre>
<p>Then:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl exec -it busybox -- opkg-install curl
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2. Or if your concern to use a minimal image, you can use alpine</strong></p>
<pre><code>image: alpine:3.12
</code></pre>
<p>then:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl exec -it alpine -- apk --update add curl
</code></pre>","<p>No.  Consider <code>alpine</code> as a base image instead that includes BusyBox plus a package manager, or building (or finding) a custom image that has the tools you need pre-installed.</p>
<p>BusyBox is built as a single binary that contains implementations of many common Linux tools.  The <a href=https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html rel=noreferrer>BusyBox documentation</a> includes a listing of the included commands.  You cannot install more commands into it without writing C code.</p>
<p>BusyBox does contain an implementation of <code>wget</code>, which might work for your purposes (<code>wget -O- http://other-service</code>).</p>","<p>BusyBox has a subset of <code>wget</code>. The usage patterns of curl are significantly more complex in your OS than the one that comes with Busybox.</p>
<p>To clarify what I mean, run the following in your OS:</p>
<pre><code>$ wget --help | wc -l
207
</code></pre>
<p>while running wgets help inside Busybox container should give you a minimal subset package:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run --rm busybox wget --help 2&gt;&amp;1 | wc -l
20
</code></pre>
<p>In K8s, you could run the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl run -i --tty --rm busybox --image=busybox -- sh
If you dont see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
/ # wget
BusyBox v1.33.1 (2021-06-07 17:33:50 UTC) multi-call binary.

Usage: wget [-cqS] [--spider] [-O FILE] [-o LOGFILE] [--header HEADER: VALUE] [-Y on/off]
    [--no-check-certificate] [-P DIR] [-U AGENT] [-T SEC] URL...

Retrieve files via HTTP or FTP

    --spider    Only check URL existence: $? is 0 if exists
    --no-check-certificate  Dont validate the servers certificate
    -c      Continue retrieval of aborted transfer
    -q      Quiet
    -P DIR      Save to DIR (default .)
    -S          Show server response
    -T SEC      Network read timeout is SEC seconds
    -O FILE     Save to FILE (- for stdout)
    -o LOGFILE  Log messages to FILE
    -U STR      Use STR for User-Agent header
    -Y on/off   
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>curl</code> is something required for your use case, I wouldsuggest to use <code>Alpine</code> which is <code>busybox</code> + a minimal package manager and <code>libc</code> implementation such that you can trivially do <code>apk add --no-cache curl</code> and get real <code>curl</code> (or even <code>apk add --no-cache wget</code> to get the real wget instead of BusyBoxs <code>wget</code>).</p>"

<h3>Note on specification</h3>
<p>This seems to follow your specification, but note that this will match things like <code>.....</code>, etc, which may or may not be what you desire. If you can be more specific what pattern you want to match, the regex will be slightly more complicated.</p>
<p>The above regex also matches the empty string. If you need at least one character, then use <code>+</code> (one-or-more) instead of <code>*</code> (zero-or-more) for repetition.</p>
<p>In any case, you can further clarify your specification (always helps when asking regex question), but hopefully you can also learn how to write the pattern yourself given the above information.</p>","<p>you can use</p>
<pre><code>^[\w.-]+$
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>+</code> is to make sure it has at least 1 character.  Need the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> to denote the begin and end, otherwise if the string has a match in the middle, such as <code>@@@@xyz%%%%</code> then it is still a match.</p>
<p><code>\w</code> already includes alphabets (upper and lower case), numbers, and underscore. So the rest <code>.</code>, <code>-</code>, are just put into the class to match.  The <code>+</code> means 1 occurrence or more.</p>
<p>P.S. thanks for the note in the comment about preventing <code>-</code> to denote a range.</p>","<p>To actually cover your pattern, i.e, valid file names according to your rules, I think that you need a little more.  Note this doesnt match legal file names from a <em>system</em> perspective.  That would be system dependent and more liberal in what it accepts.  This is intended to match your acceptable patterns.</p>
<pre><code>^([a-zA-Z0-9]+[_-])*[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+$
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^</code> Match the start of a string.  This (plus the end match) forces the string to conform to the exact expression, not merely contain a substring matching the expression.</li>
<li><code>([a-zA-Z0-9]+[_-])*</code> Zero or more occurrences of one or more letters or numbers followed by an underscore or dash.  This causes all names that contain a dash or underscore to have letters or numbers between them.</li>
<li><code>[a-zA-Z0-9]+</code> One or more letters or numbers.  This covers all names that do not contain an underscore or a dash.</li>
<li><code>\.</code> A literal period (dot).  Forces the file name to have an extension and, by exclusion from the rest of the pattern, only allow the period to be used between the name and the extension.  If you want more than one extension that could be handled as well using the same technique as for the dash/underscore, just at the end.</li>
<li><code>[a-zA-Z0-9]+</code> One or more letters or numbers.  The extension must be at least one character long and must contain only letters and numbers.  This is typical, but if you wanted allow underscores, that could be addressed as well.  You could also supply a length range <code>{2,3}</code> instead of the one or more <code>+</code> matcher, if that were more appropriate.</li>
<li><code>$</code> Match the end of the string.  See the starting character.</li>

Lisp interpreters uses a dot to visually separate the elements in the pair. So <code>(cons 1 2)</code> will print <code>(1 . 2)</code>. <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> respectively return the first and second elements of a pair. Lists are built on top of pairs. If the <code>cdr</code> of a pair points to another pair, that sequence is treated as a list. The <code>cdr</code> of the last pair will point to a special object called <code>null</code> (represented by <code>()</code>) and this tells the interpreter that it has reached the end of the list. For example, the list <code>(a b c)</code> is constructed by evaluating the following expression:</p>

<p>class Pair {

<p>function cons(Object left, Object right) {return new Pair(left, right)};</p>

1. cons(A,B) =&gt; Pair(A,B)
2. cons(A,NIL) =&gt; Pair(A,NIL)
3. cons(NIL,A) =&gt; Pair(NIL,A)
4. cons(A,cons(B,NIL)) =&gt; Pair(A, Pair(B,NIL))
5. cons(cons(A B),NIL)) =&gt; Pair(Pair(A,B),NIL)</p>
<p>Lets see lefts and rights in all cases:
1. A and B are atoms, and whole Pair is not a list, so (const a b) gives (a . b) in scheme
2. NIL is an empty list and A is an atom, (cons a ()) gives list (a)
3. NIL and A as above, but as left is list(!), (cons () a) gives pair (() . a)
4. Easy case, we have proper list here (a b).
5. Proper list, head is pair (a . b), tail is empty.</p>

Lists are pairs (of pairs), but not all pairs are lists! To be list pair have to have NIL as tail.</p>

The release is part of work in progress to support newer features in the MongoDB 4.0 upcoming release and make some other API changes.</p>
<p>One such change triggering the current warning is the <code>useNewUrlParser</code> option, due to some changes around how passing the connection URI actually works. More on that later.</p>
<p>Until things settle down, it would probably be <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/22345808/2313887>advisable to pin</a> at least to the minor version for <code>3.0.x</code> releases:</p>
<pre><code>  dependencies: {
    mongodb: ~3.0.8
  }
</code></pre>
<p>That should stop the <code>3.1.x</code> branch being installed on fresh installations to node modules. If you already did install a latest release which is the beta version, then you should clean up your packages ( and <code>package-lock.json</code> ) and make sure you bump that down to a <code>3.0.x</code> series release.</p>
<p>As for actually using the new connection URI options, the main restriction is to actually include the <code>port</code> on the connection string:</p>
<pre><code>const { MongoClient } = require(mongodb);
const uri = mongodb://localhost:27017;  // mongodb://localhost - will fail

(async function() {
  try {

    const client = await MongoClient.connect(uri,{ useNewUrlParser: true });
    // ... anything

    client.close();
  } catch(e) {
    console.error(e)
  }

})()
</code></pre>
<p>Thats a more strict rule in the new code. The main point being that the current code is essentially part of the node-native-driver ( npm <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb rel=noreferrer><code>mongodb</code></a> ) repository code, and the new code actually imports from the <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-core rel=noreferrer><code>mongodb-core</code></a> library which underpins the public node driver.</p>
<p>The point of the option being added is to ease the transition by adding the option to new code so the newer parser ( actually based around <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/url rel=noreferrer><code>url</code></a> ) is being used in code adding the option and clearing the deprecation warning, and therefore verifying that your connection strings passed in actually comply with what the new parser is expecting.</p>
<p>In future releases the legacy parser would be removed and then the new parser will simply be what is used even without the option. But by that time, it is expected that all existing code had ample opportunity to test their existing connection strings against what the new parser is expecting.</p>
<p>So if you want to start using new driver features as they are released, then use the available <code>beta</code> and subsequent releases and ideally make sure you are providing a connection string which is valid for the new parser by enabling the <code>useNewUrlParser</code> option in <code>MongoClient.connect()</code>.</p>
<p>If you dont actually need access to features related to preview of the MongoDB 4.0 release, then pin the version to a <code>3.0.x</code> series as noted earlier. This will work as documented and pinning this ensures that <code>3.1.x</code> releases are not updated over the expected dependency until you actually want to install a stable version.</p>","<p>The below highlighted code to the mongoose connection solved the warning for the mongoose driver:</p>

The parameter you pass will be the return value that the <code>java</code> process will return to the operating system.  You can make this call from anywhere in your program - and the result will always be the same - JVM terminates.  As this is simply calling a static method in <code>System</code> class, the compiler does not know what it will do - and hence does not complain about unreachable code.</p>

</ol>","<p>Because <code>System.exit()</code> is just another method to the compiler. It doesnt read ahead and figure out that the whole program will quit at that point (the JVM quits). Your OS or shell can read the integer that is passed back in the <code>System.exit()</code> method.

<p>You may say <em>But it is much faster to compare strings - no loops...</em> well, then you should note there ARE loops. First recursive loop that converts Array to string and second, that compares two strings. So this method <strong>is faster than use of string</strong>.</p>
<p><sub>I believe that larger amounts of data should be always stored in arrays, not in objects. However if you use objects, they can be partially compared too.<br/>
<strong>Heres how:</strong></sub></p>
<h2>Comparing objects:</h2>
<p>Ive stated above, that two object <strong>instances</strong> will never be equal, even if they contain same data at the moment:</p>
<pre><code>({a:1, foo:bar, numberOfTheBeast: 666}) == ({a:1, foo:bar, numberOfTheBeast: 666})  //false
</code></pre>
<p>This has a reason, since there may be, for example <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/201471/607407>private variables within objects.</a></p>
<p>However, if you just use object structure to contain data, comparing is still possible:</p>
<pre><code>Object.prototype.equals = function(object2) {
    //For the first loop, we only check for types
    for (propName in this) {
        //Check for inherited methods and properties - like .equals itself
        //https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty
        //Return false if the return value is different
        if (this.hasOwnProperty(propName) != object2.hasOwnProperty(propName)) {
            return false;
        }
        //Check instance type
        else if (typeof this[propName] != typeof object2[propName]) {
            //Different types =&gt; not equal
            return false;
        }
    }
    //Now a deeper check using other objects property names
    for(propName in object2) {
        //We must check instances anyway, there may be a property that only exists in object2
            //I wonder, if remembering the checked values from the first loop would be faster or not 
        if (this.hasOwnProperty(propName) != object2.hasOwnProperty(propName)) {
            return false;
        }
        else if (typeof this[propName] != typeof object2[propName]) {
            return false;
        }
        //If the property is inherited, do not check any more (it must be equa if both objects inherit it)
        if(!this.hasOwnProperty(propName))
          continue;
        
        //Now the detail check and recursion
        
        //This returns the script back to the array comparing
        /**REQUIRES Array.equals**/
        if (this[propName] instanceof Array &amp;&amp; object2[propName] instanceof Array) {
                   // recurse into the nested arrays
           if (!this[propName].equals(object2[propName]))
                        return false;
        }
        else if (this[propName] instanceof Object &amp;&amp; object2[propName] instanceof Object) {
                   // recurse into another objects
                   //console.log(Recursing to compare , this[propName],with,object2[propName],  both named \+propName+\);
           if (!this[propName].equals(object2[propName]))
                        return false;
        }
        //Normal value comparison for strings and numbers
        else if(this[propName] != object2[propName]) {
           return false;
        }
    }
    //If everything passed, lets say YES
    return true;
}  
</code></pre>
<p>However, remember that this one is to serve in comparing JSON like data, not class instances and other stuff. If you want to compare more complicated objects, look at <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/1144249/607407>this answer and its super long function</a>.<br/>
To make this work with <code>Array.equals</code> you must edit the original function a little bit:</p>
<pre><code>...
    // Check if we have nested arrays
    if (this[i] instanceof Array &amp;&amp; array[i] instanceof Array) {
        // recurse into the nested arrays
        if (!this[i].equals(array[i]))
            return false;
    }
    /**REQUIRES OBJECT COMPARE**/
    else if (this[i] instanceof Object &amp;&amp; array[i] instanceof Object) {
        // recurse into another objects
        //console.log(Recursing to compare , this[propName],with,object2[propName],  both named \+propName+\);
        if (!this[i].equals(array[i]))
            return false;
        }
    else if (this[i] != array[i]) {
...

<p>Think about it: Docker abstracts the OS and that is all. The Android
  OS is quite a different kernel than linux distributions, even though
  it is linux. It might be tricky to get applications meant for a linux
  distribution to run on Android/Docker.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons to use docker is that it can provide
  self-contained packages of applications which do not affect the rest
  of the system. The Android applications, packaged as .apk files are
  just that.</p>

<p>Other than that I was able to find this topic on <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19315168/running-docker-on-android>StackOverflow</a> which does not really resolve the issue.

So you can move components as best as possible, I suggest you make use of the <a href=https://java.net/projects/timingframework/pages/Home rel=nofollow noreferrer>Timing Framework</a> library.</p>
<p>But be aware: Move components is not something that should be made without study. Swing layouts were developed so that the components are placed in a specific order. If you manipulate the values ​​of dimensions and positioning of components, you will be breaking the functionality of the layouts, and your program is likely to behave in strange ways. Ive had cases where I developed an application in Swing without the use of layout. In an operating system, my program seemed to work properly, but porting it to other systems, everything went into disarray. Therefore, you need to stay tuned and perform many tests before launching an application in Swing that has such customizations.</p>
<p>This was one reason that the JavaFX technology came into our hands. With such technology, we can concern ourselves with less stuff (deploy the application in different programs) and do much more (including the one youre having trouble). Consider migrating to this technology. So you see what JavaFX can do, download the demo program <a href=https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-samples-2158687.html rel=nofollow noreferrer>Ensemble</a>. If you gain interest in this technology, I suggest you start learning it <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm rel=nofollow noreferrer>here</a>. If you dont want to download the demo, you can also find <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oKPhXSH0ZI rel=nofollow noreferrer>videos</a> on the internet that demonstrate how it works.</p>
<p>If this alternative is too laborious for you, check out the link I gave you about the Timing Framework library. There you will find examples of Java code that make smooth animations on various Swing things with a high performance. To learn how to use this library, I suggest you to get the book <a href=http://filthyrichclients.org/ rel=nofollow noreferrer>Filthy Rich Clients</a>, written by Chet Haase and Romain Guy. Although the book is out of date and things have been changed in the library code, you can get updated on the <a href=https://java.net/projects/timingframework/pages/Home rel=nofollow noreferrer>library website</a>. As I said earlier, download the library, and also download the code samples. With time, you will end up doing what you want in the best possible way.</p>
<p>I hope you can accomplish what you want. Good luck. :)</p>","<p>Here is a method I made for animating JComponents using timers.</p>
<pre><code>private void animate(JComponent component, Point newPoint, int frames, int interval) {
    Rectangle compBounds = component.getBounds();

    Point oldPoint = new Point(compBounds.x, compBounds.y),
          animFrame = new Point((newPoint.x - oldPoint.x) / frames,
                                (newPoint.y - oldPoint.y) / frames);

    new Timer(interval, new ActionListener() {
        int currentFrame = 0;
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            component.setBounds(oldPoint.x + (animFrame.x * currentFrame),
                                oldPoint.y + (animFrame.y * currentFrame),
                                compBounds.width,
                                compBounds.height);

            if (currentFrame != frames)
                currentFrame++;
            else
                ((Timer)e.getSource()).stop();

<p>I was creating a native query from a persistence EntityManager to perform an update.</p>
<pre><code>Query query = entityManager.createNativeQuery(queryString);
</code></pre>
<p>I was receiving the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>caused by: javax.persistence.TransactionRequiredException: Executing

<p>Many solutions suggest adding @Transactional to your method.
Just doing this did not change the error.</p>
<p>Some solutions suggest asking the EntityManager for a <code>EntityTransaction</code> so that you can call begin and commit yourself.
This throws another error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not allowed to create
  transaction on shared EntityManager - use Spring transactions or EJB
  CMT instead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then tried a method which most sites say is for use application managed entity managers and not container managed (which I believe Spring is) and that was <code>joinTransaction()</code>.</p>
<p>Having <code>@Transactional</code> decorating the method and then calling <code>joinTransaction()</code> on EntityManager object just prior to calling <code>query.executeUpdate()</code> and my native query update worked.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone else experiencing this issue.</p>","<p>In my case, I had the wrong <code>@Transactional</code> imported. </p>

</code></pre>
<p>tags, and are all your controls inside these? You should only have the Form
tags in the MasterPage.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here are some of my
understanding and suggestion:</p>
<p>Html  element can be put in the body of html pages and html page does
support multiple  elements, however they can not be nested each
other, you can find the detailed description from the W3C html
specification:</p>
<h1>The FORM element</h1>
<p><a href=http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/forms.html rel=nofollow noreferrer>http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/forms.html</a></p>
<p>And as for ASP.NET web form page, it is based on a single server-side form
element which contains all the controls inside it, so generally we do not
recommend that we put multiple  elements. However, this is still
supported in ASP.NET page(master page) and I think the problem in your
master page should be caused by the unsupported nested  element, and
multiple  in the same level should be ok. e.g:</p>
<p>In addition, if what you want to do through multiple forms is just make our
page posting to multiple pages, I think you can consider using the new
feature for cross-page posting in ASP.NET 2.0. This can help us use button
controls to postback to different pages without having multpile forms on
the page:</p>

<p>This code lets you bind keys to callbacks, and includes more human readable names for common keys. Take for example the usage here:</p>
<pre><code>KeyEventController.registerKey(ESCAPE, Dialog._handleEscapeKey, a);
</code></pre>
<p>The ESCAPE key is registered to make Dialogs go away. <code>handlers</code> is also empty by default, so nothing is going to happen until you use <code>registerKey</code> or append to it manually. Note that this is the only instance of <code>registerKey</code> being called.</p>
<p>It also has a lot of AJAX utility functions. Cant really send anything to Facebook from your domain anyways because of same origin policy (unless you modified security permissions, but then thats your fault). Same thing with the cookies set.</p>
<p>Theres also a history manger, but it uses an iFrame so it wont be able to read it from your domain anyways.</p>
<p>Finally the like button code I found is an iFrame, so it wouldnt need JS includes unless you were using javascript to create the iFrame or something. </p>
<p>With that in mind I dont see the need for you to include all this.</p>","<p>It looks like this is directly connected to having the Like this functionality on a page. The iframe you use to include the Like button seems to come with a couple of bonus scripts.</p>
<p>If you ask me, this is another good reason to NOT have Facebook integrated, it appears to be logging keypresses, and that is not cool.</p>","<p>A quick google search doesnt provide alot of answers - its some sort of event tracking script for Facebook, and I saw a tweet and a couple of forum posts where people mentioned disabling it and gaining a speed boost - I <strong>think</strong> you can safely get rid of it, atleast its worth giving it a try.</p>"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48058993/error-unbound-module-in-ocaml,Error: unbound module in OCaml,"<p>You have several options depending on your needs.</p>
<p>1) If you want to create a full project for your binary I recommend looking at <a href=http://jbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ rel=noreferrer>jbuilder</a>. Here is a very nice guide that explains the environment/project configuration step-by-step: <a href=https://adambard.com/blog/getting-started-with-ocaml/ rel=noreferrer>OCaml for the impatient</a>.</p>
<p>2) Another option is to compile the binary directly as you were trying to do:</p>
<pre><code>ocamlbuild -pkg lwt -pkg cohttp-lwt-unix my_test1.native

<p>Note that you need to have a file named <code>my_test1.ml</code> to generate the requested <code>my_test1.native</code>.</p>
<p>3) And finally for quick scripts I find it handy to be able to ask the OCaml interpreter to load the dependencies directly in the source file. Just add the following to the beginning of your file:</p>
<pre><code>#use topfind;;
#require lwt;;
#require cohttp-lwt-unix;;
</code></pre>
<p>And then run <code>ocaml my_test1.ml</code>.</p>

<p>In Oracle you have three kinds of SQL statements (and additionally there are PL/SQL blocks):</p>
<ul>
<li>Statements in the Data Definiton Language (DDL). These statements modify the structure of the database. They begin usually with the verbs ALTER or CREATE</li>
<li>Statements in the Data Modification Langugage (DML). There statements modify the content inside of tables, leaving the structure of each table unmodified. These statements usually begin with INSERT, MERGE or DELETE.</li>
<li>Statements in what I call query language (there seems to be no canonical name for these). This statements start with the verb SELECT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bind variables in Oracle are only allowed in some special places in DML and query statements. You are trying to use bind variables in a places where they are not allowed. Hence the error.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Build your statement without bind variables. Build the complete query string instead using string concatenation.</p>
<p>If you want to sanitize the input before concatenating the string, use the <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28419/d_assert.htm rel=noreferrer>DBMS_ASSERT</a> package.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Bind variables can only be used when Oracle can build a query plan without knowing the value of the variable. For DDL statements, there is no query plan. Hence bind variables are not allowed.</p>
<p>In DML and query statements, bind variables are only allowed, when they are used inside a tuple (regarding the underlying set theory), i.e. when the value will be compared with the value in a table or when the value will be inserted in a table. They are not allowed to change the structure of the execution plan (e.g. to change the target table or to change the number of comparisons).</p>","<p>I just spent several days checking parameters because I have to pass 60 to a stored procedure.  It turns out that the one of the variable names (which I load into a list and pass to the Oracle Write method I created) had a space in the name at the end.  When comparing to the variables in the stored procedure they were the same, but in the editor I used to compare them, I didnt notice the extra space.  Drove me crazy for the last 4 days trying everything I could find, and changing even the .net Oracle driver.  Just wanted to throw that out here so it can help someone else.

    }
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>As a commenter pointer out, the above version is susceptible to arithmetic overflow errors. Here is another version that covers the edge cases.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;limits&gt;
int isLessOrEqual(int x, int y)
{
    static int const vm = std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max();
    static int const sm = ~vm;

    return  !! ((x &amp; ~y | ~(x ^ y) &amp; ~((y &amp; vm) + ~(x &amp; vm) + 1)) &amp; sm);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation: the overall strategy is to treat the sign bit of the inputs as logically distinct from the rest of the bits, the value bits, and perform the subtraction as in the previous example on just the value bits. In this case, we need only perform the subtraction where the two inputs are either both negative or both non-negative. This avoids the arithmetic overflow condition.</p>
<p>Since the size of <code>int</code> strictly speaking is unknown at run time, we use <code>std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()</code> as a convenient mask for the value bits. The mask of the sign bit is simply the bit-wise negation of the value bits.</p>
<p>Turning to the actual expression for <code>&lt;=</code>, we factor out the bit-wise mask <code>sm</code> of the sign bit in each of the sub-expressions and push the operation to the outside of the expression. The first term of the logical expression <code>x &amp; ~y</code> is true when <code>x</code> is negative and <code>y</code> is non-negative. The first factor of the next term <code>~(x ^ Y)</code> is true when both are negative or both are non-negative. The second factor <code>~((y &amp; vm) + ~(x &amp; vm) + 1))</code> is true when <code>y - x</code> is non-negative, in other words <code>x &lt;= y</code>, <em>ignoring the sign bit</em>. The two terms are ord, so using c++ logical expression syntax we have:</p>
<pre><code>x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 0 || (x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0 || x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; y - x &gt;= 0
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>!!</code> outermost operators convert the raised sign bit to a <code>1</code>. Finally, here is the Modern C++ templated <code>constexpr</code> version:</p>
<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
constexpr T isLessOrEqual(T x, T y)
{
    using namespace std;
    // compile time check that type T makes sense for this function
    static_assert(is_integral&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp; is_signed&lt;T&gt;::value, isLessOrEqual requires signed integral params);

    T vm = numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::max();
    T sm = ~vm;

    return  !! ((x &amp; ~y | ~(x ^ y) &amp; ~((y &amp; vm) + ~(x &amp; vm) + 1)) &amp; sm);
}
</code></pre>","<p>Really enjoyed Yanagar1s answer, which is very easy to understand.</p>
<p>Actually we can remove those shift operators and use De Morgans laws, which reduce the number of operators from 15 to 11.</p>
<pre><code>long isLessOrEqual(long x, long y) {
  long sign = (x ^ y);               // highest bit will be 1 if different sign

When <code>cin &gt;&gt; inp</code> store more than 4 characters to <code>inp</code> array it leads to problem with data (somthing like undefined behaviour). So solution can be in allocation more memory for data, e.g.:</p>

<p>Fortunately c++20 has <a href=https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt2 rel=nofollow noreferrer>fixed this issue</a> and the stream operators no longer accept raw char pointers and only accept arrays and will only read up to <code>size - 1</code> characters.</p>
<p>Even with c++20 the better solution is to change your types to <code>std::string</code> which will accept any number of characters end even tell you how many characters it contains:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(){
    std::string inp, out;
    std::cin &gt;&gt; inp &gt;&gt; out;

out[0],out[1],out[2],out[3],inp[0],inp[1],inp[2],inp[3],inp[4]</p>
<p>So, when you write 6789 in out[4], you are overflowing null character to inp[0]. So, inp becomes NULL.</p>"

<p>Furthermore, just to be sure: if you use tnsnames, your login string will look different from when you use the login method you started this topic out with.</p>
<p>tnsnames.ora should be in $ORACLE_HOME$\network\admin. That is the Oracle home on the machine from which you are trying to connect, so in your case your PC. If you have multiple oracle_homes and wish to use only one tnsnames.ora, you can set environment variable tns_admin (e.g. set TNS_ADMIN=c:\oracle\tns), and place tnsnames.ora in that directory.</p>
<p>Your original method of logging on (usr/pwd@10.15.240.13:port/servicename) should always work. So far I think you have all the info, except for the port number, which I am sure your DBA will be able to give you. If this method still doesnt work, either the servers IP address is not available from your client, or it is a firewall issue (blocking a certain port), or something else not (directly) related to Oracle or SQL*Plus.</p>

Instead of inserting an absolute path in your Include and Library Directories, Id recommend using this variable to set the Include and Library path for DX dependencies.</p>
<p>As Include Directory add: <code>$(DXSDK_DIR)Include</code></p>
<p>As Library Directory add: <code>$(DXSDK_DIR)Lib\x86</code> or <code>$(DXSDK_DIR)Lib\x64</code> on a 64-bit architecture</p>

<p>The <code>$(DXSDK_DIR)</code> resolves to the path where you installed the SDK, normally C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010) and works even if you chose another path, which makes it more available between different people.</p>","<p>The library file (d3dx9.lib) should be in C:\path\to\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)\Lib\x86\ as well as in C:\path\to\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)\Lib\x64\</p>

<pre><code>lint.py --generate-rcfile &gt; standard.rc
</code></pre>
<p>This creates the <code>standard.rc</code> configuration file. Open it in Notepad and under <code>[MESSAGES CONTROL]</code>, uncomment
<code>disable=</code> and add the message IDs you want to disable, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>disable=W0511, C0321
</code></pre>
<p>Save the file, and in Eclipse â†’ <em>Window</em> â†’ <em>Preferences</em> â†’ <em>PyDev</em> â†’ *pylint, in the arguments box, type:</p>
<pre><code>--rcfile=C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\pylint\standard.rc

<p>Now it should work...</p>

<p>You can also <b>add a comment</b> at the top of your code that will be interpreted by Pylint:</p>

When running Pylint with the argument <code>--disable-ids=...</code> (at least without a configuration file), this dictionary is initially empty, raising a KeyError exception within Pylint (<code>pylint.utils.MessagesHandlerMixIn.check_message_id()</code>.</p>
<p>In Eclipse, you can see this error-message in the Pylint Console (windows* â†’ <em>show view</em> â†’ <em>Console</em>,  select Pylint console from the console options besides the console icon.)</p>","<p>Starting from Pylint v. 0.25.3, you can use the symbolic names for disabling warnings <a href=https://docs.pylint.org/en/latest/faq.html#do-i-have-to-remember-all-these-numbers rel=noreferrer>instead of having to remember all those code numbers</a>. E.g.:</p>
<pre><code># pylint: disable=locally-disabled, multiple-statements, fixme, line-too-long

<p>This style is more instructive than cryptic error codes, and also more practical since newer versions of Pylint only output the symbolic name, not the error code.</p>
<p>The correspondence between symbolic names and codes can be found <a href=http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-codes rel=noreferrer>here</a>.</p>
<p>A disable comment can be inserted on its own line, applying the disable to everything that comes after in the same block. Alternatively, it can be inserted at the end of the line for which it is meant to apply.</p>
<p>If Pylint outputs <code>Locally disabling</code> messages, you can get rid of them by including the disable <code>locally-disabled</code> <em>first</em> as in the example above.</p>"

<li><p><strong>The flush to log option makes the uninstall slow</strong> because the log file is written continuously instead of in batches. This ensures no log-buffer is lost if the setup crashes.</p>

<li><p>In other words, <strong>enable this option if your setup is crashing and there is no helpful information in your verbose log file</strong>.

<p><strong>Option 3.5 (recommended): Silent uninstall with verbose log file - suppress reboots</strong> (no flush to log - see previous option for what this means):</p>
<pre><code>msiexec.exe /x c:\filename.msi /QN /L*V C:\msilog.log REBOOT=R
msiexec.exe /x {11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111111X} /QN /L*V C:\msilog.log REBOOT=R
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>Quick Parameter Explanation (since I recommend this option):</strong></em></p>
<pre><code>/X = run uninstall sequence
/QN = run completely silently
/L*V C:\msilog.log= verbose logging at path specified
{11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111111X} = product guid of app to uninstall
REBOOT=R = prevent unexpected reboot of computer

<h1>4 - <code>Using the cached MSI database in the super hidden cache folder</code></h1>
<ul>
<li>MSI strips out all cabs (older Windows versions) and caches each MSI installed in a super-hidden system folder at <strong>%SystemRoot%\Installer</strong> (you need to show hidden files to see it).</li>
<li><strong>NB</strong>: This supper-hidden folder is now being treated differently in Windows 7 onwards. <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/1189524/129130>MSI files are now cached full-size</a>. Read the linked thread for more details - recommended read for anyone who finds this answer and fiddles with dangerous Windows settings.</li>

<li>All the MSI files here will have a random name (hex format) assigned, but you can get information about each MSI by showing the Windows Explorer status bar (View -&gt; Status Bar) and then selecting an MSI. The summary stream from the MSI will be visible at the bottom of the Windows Explorer window. Or as Christopher Galpin points out, turn on the Comments column in Windows Explorer and select the MSI file  (<a href=http://csi-windows.com/blog/all/27-csi-news-general/334-identifying-cached-msi-packages-in-cwindowsinstaller-without-opening-them rel=noreferrer><strong>see this article for how to do this</strong></a>).</li>

<li>Once you find the right MSI, just right click it and go Uninstall.</li>
<li>You can also use PowerShell to show the full path to the locally cached package along with the product name. This is the easiest option in my opinion.</li>
<li>To fire up <strong>PowerShell</strong>: <em>hold down the Windows key, tap R, release the Windows key, type in powershell and press OK</em>. Then <strong>maximize the PowerShell window</strong> and run the command below:</li>

<h1>11 - <code>Using a third-party tool such as</code> <a href=https://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER rel=noreferrer><code>ccleaner</code></a> <code>or similar</code></h1>
<ul>
<li>Several Windows applications feature their own interface for uninstalling not just MSI packages, but legacy installers too.</li>
<li>I dont want to make any specific tool recommendations here (especially commercial ones), but the well known <a href=https://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER rel=noreferrer>CCleaner</a> features such an uninstall interface (and it has a free version). I should also add that <a href=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3225407/security/ccleaner-downloads-infected-malware.html rel=noreferrer><strong>this tool suffered a malware attack recently</strong></a>.</li>
<li>I guess we should all remember that even harmless software can be injected with malware in their download locations (FTP attack).
<ul>
<li>I use <a href=https://www.virustotal.com rel=noreferrer><strong>virustotal.com</strong></a> to check my downloads, and also <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer rel=noreferrer>Sysinternals Process Explorer</a> to check running processes after installation - along with regular security software (whichever is available).</li>
<li>A surprising amount of gray area software is usually found with this approach (toolbars, smileys, adware, etc...), along with several false positives (they can also cause problems as security software block their access or quarantines them making a lot of fuzz). And certainly real malware as well.</li>
<li><a href=https://twitter.com/glytzhkof/status/943103096569454592 rel=noreferrer>Some usage tips for Process Explorer can be found here</a> - a series of tweets - this Process Explorer tool hooks up to <a href=https://www.virustotal.com rel=noreferrer>VirusTotal.com</a> to check all running processes interactively - all you need is a few configuration steps.</li>
<li>I should note that Process Explorer yields a file signature check, but no heuristics - as far as I understand (no check for suspicious operations, just a check with 60+ security suites for flagged files). You need a regular security tool for interactive, online heuristic protection.</li>
<li>For what it is worth, I think some security software border on causing more false-positive problems than malware does damage. Famous last words in the era of ransom-ware...</li>
<li>That is a large enough digression - I just dont want to see people download malware. Do your <a href=https://www.virustotal.com rel=noreferrer>virustotal.com</a> check at least.</li>

<h1>13 - <code>Using</code> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Restore rel=noreferrer><code>system restore</code></a> <code>(installation undo - last resort IMHO)</code></h1>
<ul>
<li>This is strictly speaking not a way to <strong>uninstall</strong> but to <strong>undo</strong> the last install, or several installs for that matter.</li>
<li>Restoring via a restore point brings the system back to a <strong>previous installation state</strong> (you can find video demos of this on YouTube or a similar site).</li>
<li>Note that the feature can be disabled entirely or partly - it is possible to disable permanently for the whole machine, or adhoc per install.</li>
<li><em>I have seen new, unsolvable installation problems resulting from a system restore, but normally it works OK</em>. Obviously dont use the feature for fun. Its a last resort and is best used for <strong>rollback of new drivers</strong> or setups that have just been installed and are found to cause immediate problems (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death rel=noreferrer>bluescreen</a>, reboots, instability, etc...).</li>
<li>The longer you go back the more rework you will create for yourself, and the higher the risk will be. Most systems feature only a few restore points, and most of them stretch back just a month or two I believe.</li>
<li>Be aware that system restore might affect <strong>Windows Updates</strong> that must then be re-applied - as well as many other system settings. Beyond pure annoyances, this can also cause security issues to resurface and you might want to run a specific security check on the target box(es) using <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Baseline_Security_Analyzer rel=noreferrer><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></a> or similar tools.</li>
<li>Since I mentioned system restore I suppose I should mention <a href=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307852 rel=noreferrer><strong>the Last Known Good Configuration feature</strong></a>. This feature has nothing to do with uninstall or system restore, but it is the last boot configuration that worked or resulted in a running system. It can be used to get your system running again if it bluescreens or halts during booting. This often happens after driver installs.</li>

<p>Long answer: When you run the MSI file directly at the command line, all thats happening is that it runs MSIEXEC for you. This association is stored in the registry. You can see a list of associations by (in Windows Explorer) going to Tools / Folder Options / File Types.</p>
<p>For example, you can run a .DOC file from the command line, and WordPad or WinWord will open it for you.</p>
<p>If you look in the registry under <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.msi</code>, youll see that .MSI files are associated with the ProgID Msi.Package. If you look in <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Msi.Package\shell\Open\command</code>, youll see the command line that Windows actually uses when you run a .MSI file.</p>","<p>Also remember that an uninstall can be initiated using the WMIC command:</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21812360/what-is-the-difference-between-the-sites-enabled-and-sites-available-directo,apache2 - What is the difference between the sites-enabled and sites-available directory?,"<p>The difference is that virtual sites listed in the <code>sites-enabled</code> directory are served by Apache. In the <code>sites-available</code> directory there are the virtual sites that exist on your server, but people cant access them because they are not <strong>enabled</strong> yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>sites-available:</strong> this directory has configuration files for Apache 2 Virtual Hosts. Virtual Hosts allow Apache 2 to be configured for
multiple sites that have separate configurations.</p>
<p><strong>sites-enabled:</strong> like mods-enabled, <strong>sites-enabled contains symlinks to
the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory</strong>. Similarly when a
configuration file in sites-available is symlinked, the site
configured by it will be active once Apache2 is restarted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <em><a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/httpd.html rel=noreferrer>https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/httpd.html</a></em>.</p>","<h2>Important information:</h2>
<p>You should edit files <strong>only</strong> in the <code>sites-available</code> directory.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> edit files inside the <code>sites-enabled</code> directory. Otherwise you can have problems if your editor runs out of memory or, for any reason, it receives a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#POSIX_signals rel=noreferrer>SIGHUP</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#POSIX_signals rel=noreferrer>SIGTERM</a>.</p>
<p>For example: if you are using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano rel=noreferrer>nano</a> to edit the file <code>sites-enabled/default</code> and it runs out of memory or, for any reason, it receives a SIGHUP or SIGTERM, then nano will create an emergency file called <code>default.save</code>, inside the <code>sites-enabled</code> directory.</p>
<p>So, there will be an extra file inside the <code>sites-enabled</code> directory. That will prevent Apache or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx rel=noreferrer>nginx</a> from starting. If your site was working, it will not be any more. You will have a hard time until you find out, in the logs, something related to the <code>default.save</code> file and, then, remove it.</p>
<p>In the example above, if you were editing the file inside the <code>sites-available</code> directory, nothing bad would have happened. The file <code>sites-available/default.save</code> would have been created, but it wouldnt do any harm inside the <code>sites-available</code> directory.</p>","<p>You configure your site <code>mysite</code> by creating or editing the file <code>mysite.conf</code> in <code>sites-available</code> (you can also configure several sites in the same <em>.conf</em> file, if you prefer).</p>
<p>After this, for publishing the site you must create the correspondent symlink in folder <code>sites-enabled</code>. In Ubuntu you can do it like this:</p>
<p><code>a2ensite mysite</code> (with <code>sudo</code>, if necessary; and without the final .conf)</p>
<p>And then you must reload Apache:</p>
<pre><code>sudo service apache2 reload
</code></pre>
<p>Later, if you want to modify the configuration, you only touch the <code>mysite.conf</code> file in <code>sites_available</code>. Changes apply automatically in <code>sites_enabled</code>, through the symbolic link. Just remember to reload Apache.</p>"

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33051386/dcast-warning-aggregation-function-missing-defaulting-to-length,r - dcast warning: ‘Aggregation function missing: defaulting to length’,"<p>The reason why you are getting this warning is in the description of <code>fun.aggregate</code> (see <code>?dcast</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>aggregation function needed if variables do not identify a single
  observation for each output cell. Defaults to length (with a message)
  if needed but not specified</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, an aggregation function is needed when there is more than one value for one spot in the wide dataframe.</p>
<p><strong><em>An explanation based on your data:</em></strong></p>
<p>When you use <code>dcast(df, Id + Task ~ Type, value.var=Freq)</code> you get:</p>
<pre><code>  Id Task A B
1  3    1 2 3
2  3    2 3 0
3  4    1 3 3
4  4    2 1 3
</code></pre>
<p>Which is logical because for each combination of <code>Id</code>, <code>Task</code> and <code>Type</code> there is only value in <code>Freq</code>. But when you use <code>dcast(df, Id ~ Type, value.var=Freq)</code> you get this (including a warning message):</p>
<pre><code>Aggregation function missing: defaulting to length
  Id A B
1  3 2 2
2  4 2 2
</code></pre>
<p>Now, looking back at the top part of your data:</p>
<pre><code>Id  Task Type    Freq  
3     1    A       2
3     1    B       3
3     2    A       3
3     2    B       0
</code></pre>
<p>You see why this is the case. For each combination of <code>Id</code> and <code>Type</code> there are two values in <code>Freq</code> (for Id 3: <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> for <code>A</code> &amp; <code>3</code> and <code>0</code> for Type <code>B</code>) while you can only put one value in this spot in the wide dataframe for each values of <code>type</code>. Therefore <code>dcast</code> wants to aggregate these values into one value. The default aggregation function is <code>length</code>, but you can use other aggregation functions like <code>sum</code>, <code>mean</code>, <code>sd</code> or a custom function by specifying them with <code>fun.aggregate</code>.</p>
<p>For example, with <code>fun.aggregate = sum</code> you get:</p>
<pre><code>  Id A B
1  3 5 3
2  4 4 6
</code></pre>
<p>Now there is no warning because <code>dcast</code> is being told what to do when there is more than one value: return the sum of the values.</p>","<p><code>fun.aggregate</code> is required when different values <em>inside</em> <code>value.var</code> column corresponding to <em>identical</em> values - or combination of values - appearing on the LHS of <code>dcast</code> formula (e.g. Id), are forced into one cell by the combination of variables in the RHS of the formula (e.g. Type).</p>
<p>Defaulting to <code>length()</code> in <code>dcast</code> is informative as it</p>
<ul>
<li>could suggest existence of coupling in the data, and</li>
<li>locates <code>length &gt; 1</code> cases that may require attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>More informative would be using function <code>list()</code> as <code>fun.aggregate</code> since it shows which <code>value.var</code> values are involved in each case:</p>
<pre><code>dcast(dt, Id ~ Type, fun.aggregate = list, value.var = Freq)

   Id   A   B
1:  3 2,3 3,0
2:  4 3,1 3,3
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, table cells have length = 1. Therefore, the defaulting situation in <code>dcast</code> can be solved by modifying the formula or, by implementing a length-one summarization (aggregation): operators, custom or available functions that give a length-one result in each case and are fit for the purpose.</p>",

<p>In this stack trace, the interresting pieces is the code of your program, as we can assume the code in the runtime/standard library to work.</p>
<p>Valgrind tells you 2 things here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Youre accessing memory youre not supposed to (Invalid write of size 8), in the startup function in the file server_func.c at line 32</li>
<li>The memory youre accessing is 14 bytes past a buffer of 20 bytes that you allocated at server_func.c line 28</li>
</ol>
<p>Line 28:  <code>path = (unsigned char *) realloc(path, size_of_path + sizeof(STARTUP_FILE));</code> </p>
<p>Line 32: <code>sprintf(path, %s/%s, path_to_file, STARTUP_FILE);</code></p>
<p>So on line 28 you dont allocate room for the / separator, and possibly not the nul terminator. </p>
<p>You also need to ensure <code>size_of_path</code> is correct, and that <code>sizeof(STARTUP_FILE)</code> gives you the correct size, which it will if <code>STARTUP_FILE</code> is a char array, but itll be wrong if its a char pointer. Perhaps you need to use <code>strlen(STARTUP_FILE)</code></p>
<p>Assuming <code>size_of_path</code> is correct, you might need to calculate the buffer size as <code>size_of_path + strlen(STARTUP_FILE) + 2</code></p>",,

<p>However, in your case you are not only not doing that, you (most likely) are not even reaching the end of stream.

So, what you are actually parsing with <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator in this case is actually a <code>10\n</code> sequence. Since you requested an <code>int</code> value from the stream, it only reads the numerical characters from the stream, i.e. it reads <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>, but it stops at <code>\n</code>. That <code>\n</code> remains in the stream. You never read it. So, obviously, your code never reaches the end-of-file position in the stream.

Not with 100% accuracy, anyway. The pointer <em>has no length/size but its own</em>. All it does is point to a particular place in memory that holds a char. If that char is part of a string, then you can use <code>strlen</code> to determine what chars follow the one currently being pointed to, but that doesnt mean the <em>array</em> in your case is that big.<br/>
Basically:</p>
<p>A <strong><em>pointer</em></strong> is not an <strong><em>array</em></strong>, so it doesnt <em>need</em> to know what the size of the array is. A pointer can point to a single value, so a pointer can exist without there even being an array. It doesnt even care where the memory it points to is situated (Read only, heap or stack... doesnt matter). A pointer doesnt have a length other than itself. A pointer just is...<br/>
Consider this:</p>
<pre><code>char beep = \a;
void alert_user(const char *msg, char *signal); //for some reason
alert_user(Hear my super-awsome noise!, &amp;beep); //passing pointer to single char!

void alert_user(const char *msg, char *signal)
{
    printf(%s%c\n, msg, *signal);
}
</code></pre>
<p>A pointer can be a single char, as well as the beginning, end or middle of an array...<br/>
Think of chars as structs. You sometimes allocate a single struct on the heap. That, too, creates a pointer without an array.</p>
<p>Using only a pointer, to determine how big an array it is pointing to is impossible. The closest you can get to it is using <code>calloc</code> and counting the number of consecutive \0 chars you can find through the pointer. Of course, that doesnt work once youve assigned/reassigned stuff to that arrays keys and it also fails if the memory just <em>outside</em> of the array happens to hold <code>\0</code>, too. So using this method is unreliable, dangerous and just generally silly. Dont. Do. It.</p>
<p><em>Another analogy:</em><br/>
Think of a pointer as a road sign, it points to <em>Town X</em>. The sign doesnt know what that town looks like, and it doesnt know or care (or can care) who lives there. Its job is to tell you where to find <em>Town X</em>. It can only tell you how far that town is, but not how big it is. That information is deemed irrelevant for road-signs. Thats something that you can only find out by looking at the town itself, not at the road-signs that are pointing you in its direction</p>
<p>So, using a pointer the only thing you can do is:</p>
<pre><code>char a_str[] = hello;//{h,e,l,l,o,\0}
char *arr_ptr = &amp;a_str[0];
printf(Get length of string -&gt; %d\n, strlen(arr_ptr));
</code></pre>
<p>But this, of course, only works if the array/string is \0-terminated.</p>
<p>As an aside:</p>
<pre><code>int length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(char);//sizeof char is guaranteed 1, so sizeof(a) is enough
</code></pre>
<p>is actually assigning <code>size_t</code> (the return type of <code>sizeof</code>) to an <code>int</code>, best write:</p>
<pre><code>size_t length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(*a);//best use ptrs type -&gt; good habit
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>size_t</code> is an unsigned type, if <code>sizeof</code> returns bigger values, the value of <code>length</code> might be something you didnt expect...</p>","<p>If the <code>char *</code> is 0-terminated, you can use <code>strlen</code></p>
<p>Otherwise, there is no way to determine that information</p>","<p>There are only two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the memory pointer to by your <code>char *</code> represents a C string (that is, it contains characters that have a 0-byte to mark its end), you can use <code>strlen(a)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, you need to store the length somewhere. Actually, the pointer only points to <em>one</em> <code>char</code>. But we can treat it as if it points to the first element of an array. Since the length of that array isnt known you need to store that information somewhere.</p></li>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7186676/whats-in-an-eclipse-classpath-project-file,java - Whats in an Eclipse .classpath/.project file?,"<p>Eclipse is a runtime environment for plugins. Virtually everything you see in Eclipse is the result of plugins installed on Eclipse, rather than Eclipse itself.</p>
<p>The <code>.project</code> file is maintained by the core Eclipse platform, and its goal is to describe the project from a generic, plugin-independent Eclipse view. Whats the projects name? what other projects in the workspace does it refer to? What are the builders that are used in order to build the project? (remember, the concept of build doesnt pertain specifically to Java projects, but also to other types of projects)</p>
<p>The <code>.classpath</code> file is maintained by Eclipses JDT feature (<em>feature</em> = set of plugins). JDT holds multiple such meta files in the project (see the <code>.settings</code> directory inside the project); the <code>.classpath</code> file is just one of them. Specifically, the <code>.classpath</code> file contains information that the JDT feature needs in order to properly compile the project: the projects source folders (that is, <em>what</em> to compile); the output folders (where to compile <em>to</em>); and classpath entries (such as other projects in the workspace, arbitrary JAR files on the file system, and so forth).</p>
<p>Blindly copying such files from one machine to another may be risky. For example, if arbitrary JAR files are placed on the classpath (that is, JAR files that are located outside the workspace and are referred-to by absolute path naming), the <code>.classpath</code> file is rendered non-portable and must be modified in order to be portable. There are certain best practices that can be followed to guarantee <code>.classpath</code> file portability.</p>","<p><strong><code>.project</code></strong></p>
<p>When a project is created in the workspace, a project description file is automatically generated that describes the project. The sole purpose of this file is to make the project self-describing, so that a project that is zipped up or released to a server can be correctly recreated in another workspace.</p>
<p><strong><code>.classpath</code></strong></p>
<p>Classpath specifies which Java source files and resource files in a project are considered by the Java builder and specifies how to find types outside of the project. The Java builder compiles the Java source files into the output folder and also copies the resources into it.</p>","<p>Complete reference is not available for the mentioned files, as they are extensible by various plug-ins.</p>
<p>Basically, .project files store project-settings, such as builder and project nature settings, while .classpath files define the classpath to use during running. The classpath files contains src and target entries that correspond with folders in the project; the con entries are used to describe some kind of virtual entries, such as the JVM libs or in case of eclipse plug-ins dependencies (normal Java project dependencies are displayed differently, using a special src entry).</p>"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11078487/whats-toolscontext-in-android-layout-files,xml - Whats tools:context in Android layout files?,"<p>This is the activity the tools UI editor uses to render your layout preview. It is documented <a href=https://developer.android.com/studio/write/tool-attributes#toolscontext rel=noreferrer>here</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This attribute declares which activity this layout is associated with by default. This enables features in the editor or layout preview that require knowledge of the activity, such as what the layout theme should be in the preview and where to insert onClick handlers when you make those from a quickfix</p>
</blockquote>","<p>That attribute is basically the persistence for the Associated Activity selection above the layout.  At runtime, a layout is always associated with an activity. It can of course be associated with more than one, but at least one. In the tool, we need to know about this mapping (which at runtime happens in the other direction; an activity can call setContentView(layout) to display a layout) in order to drive certain features.</p>
<p>Right now, were using it for one thing only: Picking the right theme to show for a layout (since the manifest file can register themes to use for an <em>activity</em>, and once we know the activity associated with the layout, we can pick the right theme to show for the layout). In the future, well use this to drive additional features - such as rendering the action bar (which is associated with the activity), a place to add onClick handlers, etc.</p>
<p>The reason this is a tools: namespace attribute is that this is only a designtime mapping for use by the tool. The layout itself can be used by multiple activities/fragments etc. We just want to give you a way to pick a designtime binding such that we can for example show the right theme; you can change it at any time, just like you can change our listview and fragment bindings, etc.</p>

<p>And yeah, <a href=http://tools.android.com/recent/newconfigchooser>the link</a> Nikolay listed above shows how the new configuration chooser looks and works</p>
<p>One more thing: The tools namespace is special. The android packaging tool knows to ignore it, so none of those attributes will be packaged into the APK. Were using it for extra metadata in the layout. Its also where for example the attributes to suppress lint warnings are stored -- as tools:ignore. </p>","<p>According to the <a href=http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/tools-attributes>Android Tools Project Site</a>:</p>
<p><strong>tools:context</strong> </p>
<p>This attribute is typically set on the root element in a layout XML file, and records which activity the layout is associated with (at designtime, since obviously a layout can be used by more than one layout). This will for example be used by the layout editor to guess a default theme, since themes are defined in the Manifest and are associated with activities, not layouts. You can use the same dot prefix as in manifests to just specify the activity class without the full application package name as a prefix.  </p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13006250/proper-way-to-pass-dynamic-arrays-to-other-functions,c++ - Proper way to pass dynamic arrays to other functions,"<p>Actually, the two first ideas pass the <strong>array by address</strong> and the third passes the array <strong>by reference</strong>. You can devise a little test to check this:</p>
<pre><code>void test1(int* a) {
    a[0] = 1;
}

void test2(int a[]) {
    a[1] = 2;
}

void test3(int *&amp;a) {
    a[2] = 3;
}

int main() {
    int *a = new int[3]();
    a[0] = 0;
    a[1] = 0;
    a[2] = 0;

    test1(a);
    test2(a);
    test3(a);

    cout &lt;&lt; a[0] &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; a[1] &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; a[2] &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The output of this test is</p>
<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>
<p>If a parameter is passed <strong>by value</strong>, it cannot be modified inside a function because the modifications will stay in the scope of the function. In C++, an array cannot be passed by value, so if you want to mimic this behaviour, you have to pass a <code>const int*</code> or a <code>const int[]</code> as parameters. That way, even if the array is passed by reference, it wont be modified inside the function because of the <code>const</code> property.</p>
<p>To answer your question, the preferred way would be to use a <code>std::vector</code>, but if you absolutely want to use arrays, you should go for <code>int*</code>.</p>","<p>Youre right. The first two are equivalent and pass a pointer by value. Stylistically the second is preferred as it describes the situation accurately, i.e. you are passing a pointer to your function. The first is a kind of hangover for people who cant quite believe that you cant pass arrays in C++. There is no way to pass an array by value in C++. The third passes a pointer by reference.</p>
<p>Theres a confusion here in that in all cases the pointer refers to your array. So when talking about pass by value or pass by reference you should be clear whether you are speaking about the pointer or the array it refers to.</p>","<pre><code>static void test(bool arr[])
static void test(bool *arr, size_t size)

<p>For static/dynamic arrays, if you dont want to change location of this pointer.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10583202/powermockito-mock-single-static-method-and-return-object,java - PowerMockito mock single static method and return object,"<p>What you want to do is a combination of part of 1 and all of 2.</p>
<p>You need to use the PowerMockito.mockStatic to <strong>enable</strong> static mocking for all static methods of a class.  This means make it <strong>possible</strong> to stub them using the when-thenReturn syntax.</p>
<p>But the 2-argument overload of mockStatic you are using supplies a default strategy for what Mockito/PowerMock should do when you call a method you havent explicitly stubbed on the mock instance.</p>
<p>From the <a href=http://powermock.googlecode.com/svn/docs/powermock-1.4.12/apidocs/index.html rel=noreferrer>javadoc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creates class mock with a specified strategy for its answers to
  interactions. Its quite advanced feature and typically you dont need
  it to write decent tests. However it can be helpful when working with
  legacy systems. It is the default answer so it will be used only when
  you dont stub the method call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>default</strong> default stubbing strategy is to just return null, 0 or false for object, number and boolean valued methods.  By using the 2-arg overload, youre saying No, no, no, by default use this Answer subclass answer method to get a default value.  It returns a Long, so if you have static methods which return something incompatible with Long, there is a problem.</p>
<p>Instead, use the 1-arg version of mockStatic to enable stubbing of static methods, then use when-thenReturn to specify what to do for a particular method.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16874598/how-do-i-calculate-the-md5-checksum-of-a-file-in-python,How do I calculate the MD5 checksum of a file in Python?,"<p>In regards to your error and whats missing in your code. <code>m</code> is a name which is not defined for <code>getmd5()</code> function.</p>
<p>No offence, I know you are a beginner, but your code is all over the place. Lets look at your issues one by one :)</p>
<p>First, you are not using <code>hashlib.md5.hexdigest()</code> method correctly. Please refer explanation on hashlib functions in <a href=http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/hashlib.html rel=nofollow noreferrer>Python Doc Library</a>. The correct way to return MD5 for provided <b>string</b> is to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import hashlib
&gt;&gt;&gt; hashlib.md5(filename.exe).hexdigest()
2a53375ff139d9837e93a38a279d63e5
</code></pre>
<p>However, you have a bigger problem here. You are calculating MD5 on a <b>file name string</b>, where in reality MD5 is calculated based on file <b>contents</b>. You will need to basically read file contents and pipe it though MD5. My next example is not very efficient, but something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import hashlib
&gt;&gt;&gt; hashlib.md5(open(filename.exe,rb).read()).hexdigest()
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
</code></pre>
<p>As you can clearly see second MD5 hash is totally different from the first one. The reason for that is that we are pushing contents of the file through, not just file name.</p>
<p>A simple solution could be something like that:</p>
<pre><code># Import hashlib library (md5 method is part of it)
import hashlib

# File to check
file_name = filename.exe

# Correct original md5 goes here
original_md5 = 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592  

# Open,close, read file and calculate MD5 on its contents 
with open(file_name, rb) as file_to_check:
    # read contents of the file
    data = file_to_check.read()    
    # pipe contents of the file through
    md5_returned = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()

# Finally compare original MD5 with freshly calculated
if original_md5 == md5_returned:
    print MD5 verified.
else:
    print MD5 verification failed!.
</code></pre>
<p>Please look at the post <b><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3431825/python-generating-a-md5-checksum-of-a-file>Python: Generating a MD5 checksum of a file</a></b>. It explains in detail a couple of ways how it can be achieved efficiently.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>","<p>In Python <a href=https://docs.python.org/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignment-expressions rel=noreferrer>3.8+</a> you can do</p>
<pre><code>import hashlib

with open(your_filename.png, rb) as f:
    file_hash = hashlib.md5()
    while chunk := f.read(8192):
        file_hash.update(chunk)

print(file_hash.digest())
print(file_hash.hexdigest())  # to get a printable str instead of bytes
</code></pre>
<p>On Python 3.7 and below:</p>
<pre><code>with open(your_filename.png, rb) as f:
    file_hash = hashlib.md5()
    chunk = f.read(8192)
    while chunk:
        file_hash.update(chunk)
        chunk = f.read(8192)

print(file_hash.hexdigest())
</code></pre>
<p>This reads the file 8192 (or 2¹³) bytes at a time instead of all at once with <code>f.read()</code> to use less memory.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Consider using <a href=https://docs.python.org/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.blake2b rel=noreferrer><code>hashlib.blake2b</code></a> instead of <code>md5</code> (just replace <code>md5</code> with <code>blake2b</code> in the above snippets). Its cryptographically secure and <a href=https://blake2.net/ rel=noreferrer>faster</a> than MD5.</p>","<p><code>hashlib</code> methods also support <code>mmap</code> module, so I often use</p>

  &lt;h1&gt;CSS: Horizontal Centering&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Uncentered Example&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the scenario: We have a container with an element inside of it that we want to center. I just added a little padding and background colors so both elements are distinquishable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=container  container-0 data-num=0&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=quote-0 data-num=0&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My friend Data. You see things with the wonder of a child. And that makes you more human than any of us.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt;Tasha Yar about Data&lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Solution 1: Using &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; &amp; &lt;code&gt;margin&lt;/code&gt; (IE7)&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This method is widely used. The upside here is that only the element which one wants to center needs rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.quote-1 {
  max-width: 400px;
  margin-right: auto;
  margin-left: auto;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;div class=container  container-1 data-num=1&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=quote  quote-1 data-num=1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My friend Data. You see things with the wonder of a child. And that makes you more human than any of us.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt;Tasha Yar about Data&lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Solution 2: Using &lt;code&gt;display: inline-block&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt; (IE8)&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This method utilizes that &lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt; elements are treated as text and as such they are affected by the &lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt; property. This does not rely on a fixed width which is an upside. This is helpful for when you donâ€™t know the number of elements in a container for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.container-2 {
  text-align: center;
}

.quote-2 {
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: left;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;div class=container  container-2 data-num=2&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=quote  quote-2 data-num=2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My friend Data. You see things with the wonder of a child. And that makes you more human than any of us.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt;Tasha Yar about Data&lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Solution 3: Using &lt;code&gt;display: table&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;margin&lt;/code&gt; (IE8)&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Very similar to the second solution but only requires to apply rules on the element that is to be centered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.quote-3 {
  display: table;
  margin-right: auto;
  margin-left: auto;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;div class=container  container-3 data-num=3&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=quote  quote-3 data-num=3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My friend Data. You see things with the wonder of a child. And that makes you more human than any of us.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt;Tasha Yar about Data&lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Solution 4: Using &lt;code&gt;translate()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; (IE9)&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Donâ€™t use as a general approach for horizontal centering elements. The downside here is that the centered element will be removed from the document flow. Notice the container shrinking to zero height with only the padding keeping it visible. This is what &lt;i&gt;removing an element from the document flow&lt;/i&gt; means.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are however applications for this technique. For example, it works for &lt;b&gt;vertically&lt;/b&gt; centering by using &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt; together with &lt;code&gt;translateY()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.container-4 {
    position: relative;
}

.quote-4 {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;div class=container  container-4 data-num=4&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=quote  quote-4 data-num=4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My friend Data. You see things with the wonder of a child. And that makes you more human than any of us.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt;Tasha Yar about Data&lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Solution 5: Using Flexible Box Layout Module (IE10+ with vendor prefix)&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.container-5 {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;div class=container  container-5 data-num=5&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=quote  quote-5 data-num=5&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My friend Data. You see things with the wonder of a child. And that makes you more human than any of us.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>What happened is, since <code>React</code> is exported by default from the module so I cannot wrap it with curly-braces.</p>","<p>You have two problems.</p>
<p>First, the prop you pass to <code>RenderPhotos</code> is <code>this.props.photos</code>, which is undefined in <code>AwesomeProject</code>. Looking in the <code>render()</code> function of <code>RenderPhotos</code>, you try to access the element at index 0 of <code>this.props.photos</code>, which is undefined. Thats probably whats causing your error. I suspect you meant to set the photos prop equal to <code>this.state.photos</code> in the <code>render()</code> function of the <code>AwesomeProject</code> component.</p>
<p>Second, inside <code>componentWillMount()</code> of the <code>AwesomeProject</code> component, you make two state changes after you get photos from the API:</p>
<pre><code>this.setState({
  isLoading: false
});

this.setState({
  photos: JSON.stringify(responseData)
});
</code></pre>
<p>Its possible, but not guaranteed, that React might batch those two <code>setState()</code> calls, so both state properties would be set at the same time and the <code>render()</code> method would be called only once. However, if these <code>setState()</code> functions are executed synchronously, the <code>render()</code> function will be called while <code>this.state.loading === false</code> and <code>this.state.photos === undefined</code>. The <code>RenderPhotos</code> component will mount and receive the prop <code>photos={this.state.photos}</code> (after making the change I described above). Unfortunately, because <code>this.state.photos</code> is undefined, you will encounter the same problem as above when you try to access <code>this.props.photos[0]</code> inside the <code>render()</code> function of <code>RenderPhotos</code>. Heres my suggestion to fix your problem:</p>
<pre><code>var AwesomeProject = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function() {
      return {
        isLoading: true,
        photos: this.props.photos
      };
    },
    componentWillMount: function(){
      fetch(http://localhost:3000/api/photos/, {
          method: GET, 
          headers: {
            x-access-token:xxxxx,
            x-key:xxxx
          },
        })
        .then((response) =&gt; response.json())
        .then((responseData) =&gt; {
            AlertIOS.alert(
                GET Response,
                Search Query -&gt;  + JSON.stringify(responseData)
            )
            // Set both state properties at the same time to avoid passing an undefined value as a prop to RenderPhotos
            this.setState({
              isLoading: false,
              photos: JSON.stringify(responseData)
            });
        })
        .done();
    },
    render: function() {
        if(this.state.isLoading){
          return &lt;View&gt;&lt;Text&gt;Loading...&lt;/Text&gt;&lt;/View&gt;
       }
       // RenderPhotos should receive this.state.photos as a prop, not this.props.photos
        return (
            &lt;RenderPhotos photos={this.state.photos}/&gt;
        );
    },

});

var RenderPhotos = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
      return {
        photos: this.props.photos
      };
  },
  render: function(){
    var photos = Photos;
    return (
      &lt;View&gt;
        &lt;Text&gt; {this.props.photos[0]} &lt;/Text&gt;
      &lt;/View&gt;
    )

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10990137/pygame-mouse-clicking-detection,python - Pygame mouse clicking detection,"<p>I assume your game has a main loop, and all your sprites are in a list called <code>sprites</code>.</p>
<p>In your main loop, get all events, and check for the <code>MOUSEBUTTONDOWN</code> or <code>MOUSEBUTTONUP</code> event.</p>
<pre><code>while ... # your main loop
  # get all events
  ev = pygame.event.get()

  # proceed events
  for event in ev:

    # handle MOUSEBUTTONUP
    if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
      pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()

      # get a list of all sprites that are under the mouse cursor
      clicked_sprites = [s for s in sprites if s.rect.collidepoint(pos)]
      # do something with the clicked sprites...
</code></pre>
<p>So basically you have to check for a click on a sprite yourself every iteration of the mainloop. Youll want to use <a href=http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html#pygame.mouse.get_pos>mouse.get_pos()</a> and <a href=http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#Rect.collidepoint>rect.collidepoint()</a>.</p>
<p>Pygame does not offer event driven programming, as e.g. <a href=http://cocos2d.org/>cocos2d</a> does.</p>
<p>Another way would be to check the position of the mouse cursor and the state of the pressed buttons, but this approach has some issues.</p>
<pre><code>if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] and mysprite.rect.collidepoint(pygame.mouse.get_pos()):
  print (You have opened a chest!)
</code></pre>
<p>Youll have to introduce some kind of flag if you handled this case, since otherwise this code will print <em>You have opened a chest!</em> every iteration of the main loop.</p>
<pre><code>handled = False

while ... // your loop

  if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] and mysprite.rect.collidepoint(pygame.mouse.get_pos()) and not handled:
    print (You have opened a chest!)
    handled = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0]
</code></pre>
<p>Of course you can subclass <code>Sprite</code> and add a method called <code>is_clicked</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>class MySprite(Sprite):
  ...

  def is_clicked(self):
    return pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] and self.rect.collidepoint(pygame.mouse.get_pos())
</code></pre>
<p>So, its better to use the first approach IMHO.</p>","<p>The <code>MOUSEBUTTONDOWN</code> event occurs once when you click the mouse button and the <code>MOUSEBUTTONUP</code> event occurs once when the mouse button is released. The <a href=https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.Event rel=noreferrer><code>pygame.event.Event()</code></a> object has two attributes that provide information about the mouse event. <code>pos</code> is a tuple that stores the position that was clicked. <code>button</code> stores the button that was clicked. Each mouse button is associated a value. For instance the value of the attributes is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the left mouse button, middle mouse button, right mouse button, mouse wheel up respectively mouse wheel down. When multiple keys are pressed, multiple mouse button events occur. Further explanations can be found in the documentation of the module <a href=https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html rel=noreferrer><code>pygame.event</code></a>.</p>
<p>Use the <code>rect</code> attribute of the <a href=https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Sprite rel=noreferrer><code>pygame.sprite.Sprite</code></a> object and the <a href=https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.Rect.collidepoint rel=noreferrer><code>collidepoint</code></a> method to see if the <em>Sprite</em> was clicked.
Pass the list of events to the <a href=https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Group.update rel=noreferrer><code>update</code></a> method of the <a href=https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Group rel=noreferrer><code>pygame.sprite.Group</code></a> so that you can process the events in the <em>Sprite</em> class:</p>

<p>Remember to use the mouse click event via a main event loop. The reason why the event loop is better is due to short clicks.

The possible outcome of this issue is that your python environment is super messed up.
Although I couldnt resolve this error because possibly I will have to uninstall python from my system, clear caches etc., But to quickly work on the task in hand , I was able to find a workaround</p>
<p>The workaround is:</p>
<pre><code>pip install conda

<p>Create a conda environment with your required python version. e.g:</p>
<pre><code>$ conda create --name conda_virtualenv python=3.6

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11888772/when-to-call-cudadevicesynchronize,cuda - When to call cudaDeviceSynchronize?,"<p>Although CUDA kernel launches are asynchronous, all GPU-related tasks placed in one stream (which is the default behavior) are executed sequentially.</p>
<p>So, for example,</p>
<pre><code>kernel1&lt;&lt;&lt;X,Y&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); // kernel start execution, CPU continues to next statement
kernel2&lt;&lt;&lt;X,Y&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); // kernel is placed in queue and will start after kernel1 finishes, CPU continues to next statement
cudaMemcpy(...); // CPU blocks until memory is copied, memory copy starts only after kernel2 finishes
</code></pre>
<p>So in your example, there is no need for <code>cudaDeviceSynchronize</code>. However, it might be useful for debugging to detect which of your kernel has caused an error (if there is any).</p>
<p><code>cudaDeviceSynchronize</code> may cause some slowdown, but 7-12x seems too much. Might be there is some problem with time measurement, or maybe the kernels are really fast, and the overhead of explicit synchronization is huge relative to actual computation time.</p>","<p>One situation where using <code>cudaDeviceSynchronize()</code> is appropriate would be when you have several <code>cudaStream</code>s running, and you would like to have them exchange some information. A real-life case of this is parallel tempering in quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this case, we would want to ensure that every stream has finished running some set of instructions and gotten some results before they start passing messages to each other, or we would end up passing garbage information. The reason using this command slows the program so much is that <code>cudaDeviceSynchronize()</code> forces the program to wait for all previously issued commands in all streams on the device to finish before continuing (from the CUDA C Programming Guide). As you said, kernel execution is normally asynchronous, so while the GPU device is executing your kernel the CPU can continue to work on some other commands, issue more instructions to the device, etc., instead of waiting.  However when you use this synchronization command, the CPU is instead forced to idle until all the GPU work has completed before doing anything else. This behaviour is useful when debugging, since you may have a segfault occuring at seemingly random times because of the asynchronous execution of device code (whether in one stream or many). <code>cudaDeviceSynchronize()</code> will force the program to ensure the stream(s)s kernels/memcpys are complete before continuing, which can make it easier to find out where the illegal accesses are occuring (since the failure will show up during the sync).</p>","<p>When you want your GPU to start processing some data, you typically do a kernal invocation.
When you do so, your device (The GPU) will start to doing whatever it is you told it to do. However, unlike a normal sequential program on your host (The CPU) will continue to execute the next lines of code in your program. cudaDeviceSynchronize makes the host (The CPU) wait until the device (The GPU) have finished executing ALL the threads you have started, and thus your program will continue as if it was a normal sequential program.</p>
<p>In small simple programs you would typically use cudaDeviceSynchronize, when you use the GPU to make computations, to avoid timing mismatches between the CPU requesting the result and the GPU finising the computation. To use cudaDeviceSynchronize makes it alot easier to code your program, but there is one major drawback: Your CPU is idle all the time, while the GPU makes the computation. Therefore, in high-performance computing, you often strive towards having your CPU making computations while it wait for the GPU to finish.</p>"

<p>This could be due to a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the remote server has been configured (e.g. in the SQLNET.ora file) to not accept connections from your IP.</p></li>
<li><p>If the JDBC url is incorrect, you could be attempting to connect to something that isnt a database.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are too many open connections to the database service, it could refuse new connections.</p></li>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>When the connection pool mechanism is used, the application server (in our case, it is JBOSS) creates connections according to the <code>min-connection</code> parameter. If you have 10 applications running, and each has a <code>min-connection</code> of 10, then a total of 100 sessions will be created in the database. Also, in every database, there is a <code>max-session</code> parameter, if your total number of connections crosses that border, then you will get <code>Got minus one from a read call</code>.</p>
<p>FYI: Use the query below to see your total number of sessions:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT username, count(username) FROM v$session 
WHERE username IS NOT NULL group by username

<p>Solution: With the help of our DBA, we increased that <code>max-session</code> parameter, so that all our application <code>min-connection</code> can accommodate.</p>","<p>I got this error message from using an oracle database in a docker despite the fact i had  publish port to host option -p 1521:1521.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64627331/what-is-the-difference-between-allfile-and-allmarkdownremark-in-gatsby,graphql - What is the difference between allFile and allMarkdownRemark in gatsby,"<p>It always depends on your filesystem and how it is set up.</p>
<p>The short answer is that <code>allFile</code> retrieves all kind of files (images, markdowns, JSONs, etc) set in your <code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code> while <code>allMarkdownRemark</code> only fetches the markdown files because a transformer plugin has previously created a specific node to do so.</p>
<p><code>allMarkdownRemark</code>, of course, is more specific and has better performance, since you are querying only markdown files, not all kinds of files like <code>allFile</code> does. Regarding the filters, both are available (relative and absolute paths), use the GraphQL playground (<code>localhost:8000/___graphql</code>) to test them.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p><a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/ rel=nofollow noreferrer><code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code></a> creates file nodes from files. The various transformer plugins can transform file nodes into various other types of data e.g. <code>gatsby-transformer-json</code> transforms JSON files into JSON data nodes and <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code> transforms markdown files into <code>MarkdownRemark</code> nodes from which you can query an HTML representation of the markdown.</p>
<p>Summarizing, <code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code> retrieves all types of files but must be set for each data folder to help other plugins to transform the file type into nodes to make them available to Gatsby and GraphQL.</p>
<p><code>allMarkdownRemark</code>, is another transformer plugin that turns all markdown files (previously set in the <code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code>) into GraphQL nodes to make them available when you query a markdown file, allowing you to retrieve specific data from it.</p>
<p>Lets assume a filesystem like:</p>
<pre><code>{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    name: `images`,
    path: `${__dirname}/src/images/`,
  },
},

{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    name: `jsons`,
    path: `${__dirname}/src/jsons/`,
  },
},
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    name: `markdowns`,
    path: `${__dirname}/src/markdowns/`,
  },
},
</code></pre>
<p>If you leave the filesystem like this, <code>allFile</code> will retrieve JSONs as well as images and markdowns but you wont be able to query specific data from them, because theres no transformer plugin that has created a node, in addition, you will lose all the benefits of using combined plugins. If you add the <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code> with the previous filesystem configuration like:</p>
<pre><code>{
  resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
  options: {
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-remark-relative-images`,
      },
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
        options: {
          maxWidth: 1200,
          withWebp: true,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
},
</code></pre>
<p>You are creating nodes for all markdown files and creating relative paths for images in there (<code>gatsby-remark-relative-images</code>), what saves you a few headaches and parses the images from it.</p>",,

<p>TCP (<code>SOCK_STREAM</code>) is a connection-based protocol.  The connection is established and the two parties have a conversation until the connection is terminated by one of the parties or by a network error.</p>
<p>UDP (<code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>) is a datagram-based protocol.  You send one datagram and get one reply and then the connection terminates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you send multiple packets, TCP promises to deliver them in order. 
UDP does not, so the receiver needs to check them, if the order
matters.  </p></li>
<li><p>If a TCP packet is lost, the sender can tell.  Not so for UDP.</p></li>
<li><p>UDP datagrams are limited in size, from memory I think it is 512
bytes.  TCP can send much bigger lumps than that.</p></li>
<li><p>TCP is a bit more robust and makes more checks.  UDP is a shade
lighter weight (less computer and network stress).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the protocol appropriate for how you want to interact with the other computer.</p>","<p>One of the ideas behind the <strong><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets rel=nofollow noreferrer>Berkley Sockets API</a></strong> was that it could use different <strong><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets#Protocol_and_address_families rel=nofollow noreferrer>protocol families</a></strong> - not just the Internet Protocol (IP). But instead you had one API that could handle all kinds of <em>address families</em>, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4): <code>AF_INET</code></li>
<li>IPX/SPX: <code>AF_IPX</code></li>
<li>AppleTalk: <code>AF_APPLETALK</code></li>
<li>NetBIOS: <code>AF_NETBIOS</code></li>
<li>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6): <code>AF_INET6</code></li>
<li>Infrared Data Association (IrDA): <code>AF_IRDA</code></li>
<li>Bluetooth: <code>AF_BTH</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Each <em>protocol family</em> generally has a few similar concepts of how data will be handled on a socket:</p>
<ul>
<li>sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based, byte-streams: <code>SOCK_STREAM</code> <em>(what an IP person would call TCP)</em></li>
<li>connectionless, unreliable, datagrams: <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> <em>(what an IP person would call UDP)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Different address families have different terms for these basic concepts:</p>
<pre><code>╔═══════════╦══════════════════════════╗
║           ║       Socket Type        ║
║ Address   ╟────────────┬─────────────╢

<p>The point is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want reliable, two-way, connection-based, sequenced, byte-streams</li>
<li>you ask for it using <em>SOCK_STREAM</em></li>
<li>and the <strong>sockets</strong> API will worry about figuring out that you want TCP</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, if i were creating a socket over Infrared (IrDA, <code>AF_IRDA</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>i have no idea what protocol in <strong>IrDA</strong> is reliable, sequenced, and connection-based</li>
<li>all i know is that i want <em><strong>something</strong></em> that is reliable, sequence, and connection-based</li>
</ul>
<p>So you say:</p>
<pre><code>socket(AF_IRDA, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>And Sockets will figure it out for me.</p>
<h1>Bonus</h1>
<p>Originally there was only the two protocol options:</p>
<ul>
<li>connectionless, unreliable, datagrams (<code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>)</li>
<li>connection-based, reliable, sequenced, two-way (<code>SOCK_STREAM</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Later other protocol choices were added:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reliable message datagram (<code>SOCK_RDM</code> - <em>Reliable Datagram Multicast</em> - obsolete; do not use in new programs)</li>
<li>pseudo-stream sequenced packets based on datagrams (<code>SOCK_SEQPACKET</code>)</li>

<p>Its not guaranteed that any given address family will support such protocol choices; but some do.</p>
<h2>Bonus Bonus Chatter</h2>
<p>Hopefully now you see why it is redundant to pass <code>IPPROTO_TCP</code> protocol in your call to create a socket:</p>
<pre><code>socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP); // passing IPPROTO_TCP is redundant
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);           // better
</code></pre>
<p>You already said you wanted a <code>SOCK_STREAM</code>. You dont need to force <code>TCP</code> on top of it. In the same way its redundant to call:</p>
<pre><code>socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP); //passing IPPROTO_UDP is redundant
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);           // better
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong></em> Its a protocol-independent way of asking for TCP or UDP. But since nobody on the planet uses AppleTalk, IPX/SPX, IrDA, Bluetooth, NetBIOS anymore, its mostly vestigial.</p>","<p><strong>Update:</strong> my answer seems no more relevant, but the original question referred to UDT, which is a connection-oriented protocol built on top of UDP. More info here: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP-based_Data_Transfer_Protocol rel=nofollow>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP-based_Data_Transfer_Protocol</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>UDT appears to provide API which mimics classic BSD sockets API, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement, for both stream and datagram oriented applications. Check e.g. <code>sendmsg</code> and <code>recvmsg</code> - both throw an exception if used on a socket created with <code>SOCK_STREAM</code>, and all the stream oriented APIs throw an exception for socket created with <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> as well.</p>
<p>In case of <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> it  perform some extra processing however, it doesnt simply wrap the UDP socket transparently in such case - as far as I understand the code after a quick review (Im not familiar with UDT internals or protocol spec). Reading the <a href=http://udt.sourceforge.net/doc.html rel=nofollow>technical papers</a> could help a lot.</p>
<p>The library always creates its underlying, real socket as a datagram one (check channel.cpp, <code>CChannel::open</code>).</p>"

<pre class=lang-py prettyprint-override><code>name = user
button.clicked.connect(lambda: calluser(name))
</code></pre>","<p>I tried an efficient way of doing it and it worked out well for me. You can use the code:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import partial

def calluser(name):
    print name

def Qbutton():
    button = QtGui.QPushButton(button,widget)
    name = user
    button.setGeometry(100,100, 60, 35)
    button.clicked.connect(partial(calluser,name))
</code></pre>","<p>Usually GUIs are built using classes. By using bound methods as callbacks (see <code>self.calluser</code> below) you can pass information to the callback through <code>self</code>s attributes (e.g. <code>self.name</code>):</p>
<p>For example, using slightly modified code from <a href=http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/widgets/ rel=noreferrer>this tutorial</a>: </p>
<pre><code>import sys
import PyQt4.QtCore as QtCore
import PyQt4.QtGui as QtGui

class QButton(QtGui.QWidget):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent)
        self.button = QtGui.QPushButton(Button, self)

    app.exec_()

if __name__==__main__:
    demo_QButton()

<hr/>
<p>Since the callback per se is always called with no additional arguments, when you need to pass distinct additional information to many callbacks, you need to make different callbacks for each button. </p>
<p>Since that can be laborious (if done manually), use a function factory instead. See below for an example. The function factory is a closure. It can be passed additional arguments, which the inner function can access when called:</p>
<pre><code>class ButtonBlock(QtGui.QWidget):

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super(QtGui.QWidget, self).__init__()
        grid = QtGui.QGridLayout()
        names = (One, Two, Three, Four, Five,
                 Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten)
        for i, name in enumerate(names):
            button = QtGui.QPushButton(name, self)
            button.clicked.connect(self.make_calluser(name))
            row, col = divmod(i, 5)
            grid.addWidget(button, row, col)
        self.setLayout(grid)

    def make_calluser(self, name):

Your app causes an unhandled runtime exception during shutdown.  Some  runtime exceptions are actually handled if you dont handle them yourself, and some of these default handlers call <code>abort()</code>.  By default, <code>abort</code> calls:</p>
<pre><code>_call_reportfault(_CRT_DEBUGGER_ABORT, STATUS_FATAL_APP_EXIT, EXCEPTION_NONCONTINUABLE);

<p><code>abort</code> is a generic termination - it doesnt know what specific exception prompted it to be called, hence the generic unknown software exception message.</p>
<p>One path to abort is via the _purecall exception - calling an unimplemented pure virtual call.  </p>

<p>Basically to catch that error first, you need to register a handler on <code>error</code>, so the unhandled error wont be thrown anymore: <code>out.on(error, function (err) { /* handle errors here */ })</code>. Some more explanation <a href=https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/636 rel=noreferrer>here</a>.</p>

<li><p>Add a <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/433ysdt1.aspx rel=noreferrer>binding redirect</a>. This will suppress the warning. However, your .Net 2.0 projects will (at runtime) be bound to the .Net 3.5 versions of dependent assemblies such as <code>System.Windows.Forms</code>. You can quickly add a binding redirect by double-clicking on error in Visual Studio.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>CopyLocal=true</code>. Im not sure if this will suppress the warning. It will, like option 2 above, mean that all projects will use the .Net 3.5 version of System.Windows.Forms.</p></li>

</ul>","<p>Basically this happens when the assemblies youre referencing have Copy Local set to True, meaning that a copy of the DLL is placed in the bin folder along with your exe.</p>

<p>The way Ive gotten around it is to set Copy Local to False for references in assembly projects. Only do it for executables/web applications where you need the assembly for the finished product to run.</p>

<p>In each of the following SQL statements, Ive omitted the <code>where</code> clause for brevity; obviously, youd want to add that back.</p>
<p>Update name:</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE test SET data = jsonb_set(data, {name}, my-other-name);
</code></pre>
<p>Replace the tags (as oppose to adding or removing tags):</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE test SET data = jsonb_set(data, {tags}, [tag3, tag4]);
</code></pre>
<p>Replacing the second tag (0-indexed):</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE test SET data = jsonb_set(data, {tags,1}, tag5);
</code></pre>
<p>Append a tag (<strike>this will work as long as there are fewer than 999 tags; changing argument 999 to 1000 or above generates an error</strike>. This no longer appears to be the case in Postgres 9.5.3; a much larger index can be used):</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE test SET data = jsonb_set(data, {tags,999999999}, tag6, true);

<p>Remove the last tag:</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE test SET data = data #- {tags,-1}

<p>Complex update (delete the last tag, insert a new tag, and change the name):  </p>

    jsonb_set(data #- {tags,-1}, {tags,999999999}, tag3, true), 
    {name}, my-other-name);
</code></pre>
<p>Its important to note that in each of these examples, youre not actually updating a single field of the JSON data. Instead, youre creating a temporary, modified version of the data, and assigning that modified version back to the column. In practice, the result should be the same, but keeping this in mind should make complex updates, like the last example, more understandable. </p>
<p>In the complex example, there are three transformations and three temporary versions: First, the last tag is removed. Then, that version is transformed by adding a new tag. Next, the second version is transformed by changing the <code>name</code> field. The value in the <code>data</code> column is replaced with the final version.</p>","<p>Ideally, you dont use JSON documents for structured, regular data that you want to manipulate inside a relational database.

<p>JSON is primarily intended to store whole documents that do not need to be manipulated inside the RDBMS. Related:</p>

<p>Updating a row in Postgres always writes a new version of the <em>whole</em> row. Thats the basic principle of <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc-intro.html rel=nofollow noreferrer>Postgres MVCC model</a>. From a performance perspective, it hardly matters whether you change a single piece of data inside a JSON object or all of it: a new version of the row has to be written.</p>
<p>Thus the <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-DOC-DESIGN rel=nofollow noreferrer>advice in the manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JSON data is subject to the same concurrency-control considerations as
any other data type when stored in a table. Although storing large
documents is practicable, keep in mind that any update acquires a
row-level lock on the whole row. Consider limiting JSON documents to a
manageable size in order to decrease lock contention among updating
transactions. Ideally, JSON documents should each represent an atomic
datum that business rules dictate cannot reasonably be further
subdivided into smaller datums that could be modified independently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gist of it: to modify <em>anything</em> inside a JSON object, you have to assign a modified object to the column. Postgres supplies limited means to build and manipulate <code>json</code> data in addition to its storage capabilities. The arsenal of tools has grown substantially with every new release since version 9.2. But the principal remains: You <em>always</em> have to assign a complete modified object to the column and Postgres always writes a new row version for any update.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28154066/how-to-convert-datetime-to-integer-in-python,How to convert datetime to integer in python,"<p>It depends on what the integer is supposed to encode. You could convert the date to a number of milliseconds from some previous time. People often do this affixed to 12:00 am January 1 1970, or 1900, etc., and measure time as an integer number of milliseconds from that point. The <code>datetime</code> module (or others like it) will have functions that do this for you: for example, you can use <code>int(datetime.datetime.utcnow().timestamp())</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to semantically encode the year, month, and day, one way to do it is to multiply those components by order-of-magnitude values large enough to juxtapose them within the integer digits:</p>
<p>2012-06-13 --&gt; 20120613 = 10,000 * (2012) + 100 * (6) + 1*(13)</p>
<pre><code>def to_integer(dt_time):
    return 10000*dt_time.year + 100*dt_time.month + dt_time.day
</code></pre>
<p>E.g.</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: import datetime

In [2]: %cpaste
Pasting code; enter -- alone on the line to stop or use Ctrl-D.
:def to_integer(dt_time):
:    return 10000*dt_time.year + 100*dt_time.month + dt_time.day
:    # Or take the appropriate chars from a string date representation.
:--

In [3]: to_integer(datetime.date(2012, 6, 13))
Out[3]: 20120613
</code></pre>
<p>If you also want minutes and seconds, then just include further orders of magnitude as needed to display the digits.</p>
<p>Ive encountered this second method very often in legacy systems, especially systems that pull date-based data out of legacy SQL databases.</p>
<p>It is <strong>very bad</strong>. You end up writing a lot of hacky code for aligning dates, computing month or day offsets as they would appear in the integer format (e.g. resetting the month back to 1 as you pass December, then incrementing the year value), and boiler plate for converting to and from the integer format all over.</p>
<p>Unless such a convention lives in a deep, low-level, and thoroughly tested section of the API youre working on, such that everyone who ever consumes the data really can count on this integer representation and all of its helper functions, then you end up with lots of people re-writing basic date-handling routines all over the place.</p>
<p>Its generally much better to leave the value in a date context, like <code>datetime.date</code>, for as long as you possibly can, so that the operations upon it are expressed in a natural, date-based context, and not some lone developers personal hack into an integer.</p>","<p>I think I have a shortcut for that:</p>
<pre><code># Importing datetime.
from datetime import datetime

# Creating a datetime object so we can test.
a = datetime.now()

# Converting a to string in the desired format (YYYYMMDD) using strftime
# and then to int.
a = int(a.strftime(%Y%m%d))

which displays the scope value <code>$scope.val</code> inserted into html where <code>val</code> is a variable name.</p>
<p><strong>ng-model</strong> is intended to be put inside of form elements and has two-way data binding ($scope --&gt; view and view --&gt; $scope) e.g. <code>&lt;input ng-model=val/&gt;</code>.</p>","<p><em>tosh</em>s answer gets to the heart of the question nicely. Heres some additional information....</p>
<h1>Filters &amp; Formatters</h1>
<p><code>ng-bind</code> and <code>ng-model</code> both have the concept of transforming data before outputting it for the user. To that end, <code>ng-bind</code> uses <em>filters</em>, while <code>ng-model</code> uses <em>formatters</em>.</p>
<h2>filter (ng-bind)</h2>
<p>With <code>ng-bind</code>, you can use a <em>filter</em> to transform your data. For example,</p>
<p><code>&lt;div ng-bind=mystring | uppercase&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, </p>
<p>or more simply: </p>
<p><code>&lt;div&gt;{{mystring | uppercase}}&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<p>Note that <a href=https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/uppercase><code>uppercase</code> is a built-in angular filter</a>, although you can also <a href=https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_09>build your own filter</a>.</p>
<h2>formatter (ng-model)</h2>
<p>To create an ng-model formatter, you create a directive that does <code>require: ngModel</code>, which allows that directive to gain access to ngModels <code>controller</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>app.directive(myModelFormatter, function() {
  return {
    require: ngModel,
    link: function(scope, element, attrs, controller) {
     controller.$formatters.push(function(value) {
        return value.toUpperCase();
      });
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then in your partial:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input ngModel=mystring my-model-formatter /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is essentially the <code>ng-model</code> equivalent of what the <code>uppercase</code> <em>filter</em> is doing in the <code>ng-bind</code> example above. </p>
<hr/>
<h1>Parsers</h1>
<p>Now, what if you plan to allow the user to change the value of <code>mystring</code>? <code>ng-bind</code> only has one way binding, from <strong>model</strong>--&gt;<strong>view</strong>. However, <code>ng-model</code> can bind from <strong>view</strong>--&gt;<strong>model</strong> which means that you may allow the user to change the models data, and using a <em>parser</em> you can format the users data in a streamlined manner. Heres what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>app.directive(myModelFormatter, function() {
  return {
    require: ngModel,
    link: function(scope, element, attrs, controller) {
     controller.$parsers.push(function(value) {
        return value.toLowerCase();
      });
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h1>What Else?</h1>
<p><code>ng-model</code> also has built-in validation. Simply modify your <code>$parsers</code> or <code>$formatters</code> function to call <a href=https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/ngModel.NgModelController><strong>ngModel</strong>s <code>controller.$setValidity(validationErrorKey, isValid)</code> function</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href=https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/ngModel.NgModelController>Angular 1.3 has a new $validators array</a></strong> which you can use for validation instead of <code>$parsers</code> or <code>$formatters</code>.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17761328/what-are-axf-files/17764114,c - What are .axf files?,"<p>The AXF file is an <em>object file format</em> generated by ARMs RealView compiler (also part of Keils ARM-MDK) and contains both object code and debug information.  In the debugger, while just the object code is loaded on the target itself, both the code and the debug information are loaded in the development hosts memory.</p>
<p>When debugging (of any kind - not just crashes) via JTAG, SWD or other connection the code needs to be available on the host along with the debug information that associates that code with the original source code. Over the debug connection, only minimal data such as register values are transferred, so for example the debugger will take the program counter value and be able to display the assembler and source code which is available on the host using the debug data in the AXF.</p>
<p>The MAP file contains <em>some</em> of the same information, but it is intended for human readability and consumption rather than machine use, and does not contain the <em>source code line to object code</em> association data needed by source level debugger.</p>
<p>Mostly you can ignore it - the compiler generates it, the debugger loads it.  Your toolchain probably also generates a .hex file which is what youd use for production programming and contains just the machine code and constant data and initialisers.</p>",,

<p><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/fdcL3.gif/></p>
<p>So, <code>O(N*log(N))</code> is far better than <code>O(N^2)</code>. It is much closer to <code>O(N)</code> than to <code>O(N^2)</code>.</p>
<p>But your <code>O(N^2)</code> algorithm is faster for <code>N &lt; 100</code> in real life. There are a lot of reasons why it can be faster. Maybe due to better memory allocation or other non-algorithmic effects. Maybe <code>O(N*log(N))</code> algorithm requires some data preparation phase or <code>O(N^2)</code> iterations are shorter. Anyway, Big-O notation is only appropriate in case of large enough Ns.</p>
<p>If you want to demonstrate why one algorithm is faster for small Ns, you can measure <em>execution time of 1 iteration</em> and <em>constant overhead</em> for both algorithms, then use them to correct theoretical plot:</p>
<p><a href=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot%200.33%20*%20n%5E2%20and%201000%20%2b%205*%20n*log%20n%20where%20n%20from%200%20to%20200 rel=noreferrer>Example</a></p>
<p><img alt=enter image description here src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYtUk.png/></p>
<p>Or just measure execution time of both algorithms for different <code>Ns</code> and plot empirical data.</p>","<p>Just ask <a href=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lim%20n%20log%28n%29%20/%20n%5E2>wolframalpha</a> if you have doubts.</p>
<p>In this case, it says</p>
<pre><code>     n log(n)
lim --------- = 0
       n^2
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can also calculate the limit yourself:</p>
<pre><code>     n log(n)        log(n)   (Hôpital)       1/n          1
lim --------- = lim --------      =     lim ------- = lim --- = 0
       n^2             n                       1           n
</code></pre>
<p>That means <code>n^2</code> grows faster, so <code>n log(n)</code> is smaller (better), when <code>n</code> is high enough.</p>","<p>Big-O notation is a notation of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_computational_complexity>asymptotic complexity</a>. This means it calculates the complexity when N is arbitrarily large.</p>
<p>For small Ns, a lot of other factors come in. Its possible that an algorithm has O(n^2) loop iterations, but each iteration is very short, while another algorithm has O(n) iterations with very long iterations. With large Ns, the linear algorithm will be faster. With small Ns, the quadratic algorithm will be faster.</p>
<p>So, for small Ns, just measure the two and see which one is faster. No need to go into asymptotic complexity.</p>
<p>Incidentally, dont write the basis of the log. Big-O notation ignores constants - O(17 * N) is the same as O(N). Since log<sub>2</sub>N is just <code>ln N / ln 2</code>, the basis of the logarithm is just another constant and is ignored.</p>"

In PHP add this to your cUrl setopts:</p>

<p>p.s: this should be a temporary solution. Since this is a certificate error, best thing is to have the certificate fixed ofcourse!</p>","<p>The common name in the certicate for <code>api.evercam.io</code> is for <code>*.herokuapp.com</code> and there are no alternative subject names in the certificate. This means, that the certificate for <code>api.evercam.io</code> does not match the hostname and therefore the certificate verification fails.
Same as true for <code>www.evercam.io</code>, e.g. try <a href=https://www.evercam.io rel=noreferrer>https://www.evercam.io</a> with a browser and you get the error message, that the name in the certificate does not match the hostname. </p>
<p>So it is a problem which needs to be fixed by evercam.io. If you dont care about security, man-in-the-middle attacks etc you might disable verification of the certificate (<code>curl --insecure</code>), but then you should ask yourself why you use https instead of http at all.</p>"

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6435404/c-error-double-free-or-corruption-fasttop,vector - C++ error: double free or corruption (fasttop),"<p>You forgot to define <code>operator=</code> for your class. This is the rule of Big Three (copy ctor, dtor, assignment must all be defined).</p>","<p>n.m. has already given a fine answer, but I found this question interesting so I decided to try to understand it a little better.</p>
<p>It turns out then when you call <code>erase()</code> on the first item of an iterator (which we will call <code>item0</code>), heres what the iterator does: it uses the <code>=</code> operator of your class to do <code>item0 = item1</code>.  Then it deletes <code>item1</code>.</p>
<p>If you dont define your own <code>=</code> operator, I think it will simply copy the memory of your object over from <code>item1</code> to <code>item0</code>, so <code>item0</code> and <code>item1</code> will temporarily be pointing to the same string.  Then when <code>item1</code> gets deleted, the string gets freed, leaving <code>item0</code> in an invalid state because it has a pointer to memory that has been freed.</p>
<p>Here is some simple test code that reproduces and illuminates the problem:</p>

<p><a href=https://ruby-doc.org/core/ARGF.html rel=noreferrer><code>ARGF</code></a> is your friend when it comes to input; it is a virtual file that gets all input from named files or all from STDIN.</p>

# print all the lines in every file passed via command line that contains login
ARGF.each do |line|
    puts line if line =~ /login/

<p>Thank goodness we didn’t get the diamond operator in Ruby, but we did get <code>ARGF</code> as a replacement. Though obscure, it actually turns out to be useful. Consider this program, which prepends copyright headers in-place (thanks to another Perlism, <code>-i</code>) to every file mentioned on the command-line:</p>

Header = DATA.read

ARGF.each_line do |e|

<p>then</p>
<p><em>x(t) ⋅ w(t + 1) = x(t) ⋅ w(t) + x(t) ⋅ (y(t) x(t)) = x(t) ⋅ w(t) + y(t) [x(t) ⋅ x(t))]</em>.</p>

<p>How does this move the boundary relative to <em>x(t)</em>?</p>

<p>In response to OPs additional question, here is how to plot multiple rasters as requested.</p>
<p>Assuming all rasters have the same extent, resolution, projections, etc., you can stack them into a <code>RasterStack</code>, and then use <code>levelplot</code> on the stack.

If you want to suppress strip labels above each panel (as Ive done below - by default they are labelled with the stacks layer names [see <code>names(s)</code>]), you can add <code>strip.border</code> and <code>strip.background</code> to the list passed to <code>par.settings</code>.</p>

This idiom has particular uses in the case of <a href=http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm rel=noreferrer>declaring keyword functions with default parameters</a>. <code>is</code> tests identity in Python. Because there is one and only one instance of <code>None</code> present in a running Python script/program, <code>is</code> is the optimal test for this. As <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3965104/not-none-test-in-python/3965165#3965165>Johnsyweb points out</a>, this is discussed in <a href=http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ rel=noreferrer>PEP 8</a> under Programming Recommendations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with <code>is</code> or <code>is not</code>, never the equality operators.</p>
<p>Also, beware of writing <code>if x</code> when you really mean <code>if x is not None</code> — e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to None was set to some other value.  The other value might have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean context!</p>

<p>PEP 8 is essential reading for any Python programmer.</p>","<p>The best bet with these types of questions is to see exactly what python does. The <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html rel=noreferrer><code>dis</code></a> module is incredibly informative:</p>

<p>The error is caused by using a primitive type, which cannot be used as a generic type argument.

<li><p>Set it to the top-level directory of the project:</p>
<p><code>sonar.java.binaries=.</code></p>

<p>Note that the above also applies to <code>sonar.sources</code>, and it is likely going to need to be in sync with <code>sonar.java.binaries</code>.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42374151/all-com-android-support-libraries-must-use-the-exact-same-version-specification,build.gradle - All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification,"<p>You can solve this with one of the following solutions:</p>
<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>As of Android studio 3.0, it becomes much easier as it now shows a more helpful hint, so we only need to follow this hint.<br/>
for example:
<img alt=1] src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/BObtK.png/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version
  specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found
  versions 27.0.2, 26.1.0. Examples include
  com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:27.0.2 and
  com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0</p>
<p>there are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that
  are incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is
  compiling with a version of the Android support libraries that is not
  the latest version (or in particular, a version lower than your
  targetSdkVersion.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Add explicitly the library with the old version but with a new version number.<br/>
in my case <code>com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0</code> so I need to add:  </p>
<pre><code>implementation com.android.support:customtabs:27.0.2  
</code></pre>
<p>ie: Take the library from the second item, and implement it with the version number from the first.</p>
<p>Note: dont forget to press sync now so gradle can rebuild the dependency graph and see if there are any more conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br/>
you may be confused by the error message as dont use <code>customtabs</code> so how I have a conflict!!<br/>
well.. you didnt use it directly but one of your libraries uses an old version of <code>customtabs</code> internally, so you need to ask for it directly.  </p>
<p>if you curious to know which of your libraries is responsible for the old version and maybe ask the author to update his lib, Run a Gradle dependency report, see the old answer to know how.</p>
<p>Note this </p>
<hr/>
<h2>Old answer:</h2>
<p>inspired by <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/42582204/1843331>CommonsWare answer</a>:</p>
<p>Run a Gradle dependency report to see what your full tree of
dependencies is.</p>
<p>From there, you will see which one of your libraries are asking for a different version of the Android Support libraries.
For whatever it is asking for, you can ask for it directly with the
25.2.0 version or use Gradles other conflict resolution approaches to get the same versions.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>As of gradle plugin version: 3.0 <code>compile</code> has been replaced by <code>implementation</code> or <code>api</code> see <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/44493379/3998402>this answer</a> for the difference.</p>
<p>hence use instead:</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew -q dependencies app:dependencies --configuration debugAndroidTestCompileClasspath
</code></pre>
<p>or for windows cmd: </p>
<pre><code>gradlew -q dependencies app:dependencies --configuration debugAndroidTestCompileClasspath
</code></pre>
<p>and search for the conflicted version.</p>
<p>For me, the error disappeared after removing <code>com.google.android.gms:play-services:10.2.0</code></p>
<p>And only include <code>com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:10.2.0</code> and <code>com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:10.2.0</code> as they are the only two play services that I use.</p>
<p>I think the <code>gms:play-services</code> depend on some old components of the support library, so we need to add them explicitly ourselves.</p>
<hr/>
<p>for AS 3.0 an older.</p>
<p>Run:</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew -q dependencies &lt;module-name&gt;:dependencies --configuration implementation
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your terminal can display color, but most diff tools dont make good use of it. By highlighting changes, icdiff can show you the differences between similar files without getting in the way. This is especially helpful for identifying and understanding small changes within existing lines.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to be a diff replacement for all circumstances, the goal of icdiff is to be a tool you can reach for to get a better picture of what changed when its not immediately obvious from diff.</p>

<p>IMHO, its output is much more readable than <code>diff -y</code>.</p>"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589193/clearing-my-form-inputs-after-submission,javascript - Clearing my form inputs after submission,"<p>Your form is being submitted already as your button is type <code>submit</code>.  Which in most browsers would result in a form submission and loading of the server response rather than executing javascript on the page.</p>
<p>Change the type of the submit button to a <code>button</code>.  Also, as this button is given the id <code>submit</code>, it will cause a conflict with Javascripts submit function.  Change the id of this button.  Try something like</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input type=button value=Submit id=btnsubmit onclick=submitForm()&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Another issue in this instance is that the name of the form contains a <code>-</code> dash.  However, Javascript translates <code>-</code> as a minus.</p>
<p>You will need to either use array based notation or use <code>document.getElementById()</code> / <code>document.getElementsByName()</code>. The <code>getElementById()</code> function returns the element instance directly as Id is unique (but it requires an Id to be set).  The <code>getElementsByName()</code> returns an array of values that have the same name.  In this instance as we have not set an id, we can use the <code>getElementsByName</code> with index 0.</p>
<p>Try the following</p>
<pre><code>function submitForm() {
   // Get the first form with the name
   // Usually the form name is not repeated
   // but duplicate names are possible in HTML
   // Therefore to work around the issue, enforce the correct index
   var frm = document.getElementsByName(contact-form)[0];
   frm.submit(); // Submit the form
   frm.reset();  // Reset all form data
   return false; // Prevent page refresh
}
</code></pre>","<p>since you are using <code>jquery</code> library, i would advise you utilize the <code>reset()</code> method. </p>
<p>Firstly, add an id attribute to the form tag</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form id=myForm&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then on completion, clear your input fields as:</p>
<pre><code>$(#myForm)[0].reset();
</code></pre>","<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>function submitForm() {
  $(form[name=contact-form]).submit();
  $(input[type=text], textarea).val();
