<p>Wispy lash extensions are eyelash extensions inspired by Kim Kardashian that make your eyes look wider and brighter. They are the perfect glamour girl look and will definitely turn heads.</p>
<p>As a beauty expert with more than six years in the industry, I’ve applied many lashes for clients. I can help you with the correct way to apply your lashes, walk you through your different options, and help you keep the integrity of your natural lashes.</p>
<p>So, let’s get into the what, how, when, and which of eyelash extensions.</p>
<p>From the supplies you’ll need to the different eyelash styles and maintenance tips, this guide explains what wispy eyelash extensions are and how to keep your lashes safe when using them.</p>
<h2>What are wispy eyelash extensions?</h2>
<p>Besides providing window dressing for your eyes, the <a href=""/lash-extensions/"">main idea behind all lash extensions is having perfect lashes</a> without having to put any makeup on.</p>
<p>Wispy eyelash extensions, also called Kim K lashes, are a special kind of extension created by using a handmade lash fan with 2-6 lashes and applying it to the lash line in alternating lengths.</p>
<p>The final result is a set of dramatic lash extensions that mimic the look of strip lashes but with the visual impact of volume lashes.</p>
<h2>What is a wispy eyelash?</h2>
<p>Wispy eyelashes are a style of lash extension that appears fine and fluffy. Wispy lashes are one of the most common types of lashes because they look similar to natural lashes.</p>
<p>Note: Strip lashes also come as wispies. For false eyelashes my go-to are <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F5YU56Y?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=6c5826a0e3ad3bcc10771af549fed76e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ardell Wispies</a>.</p>
<h2>Lash supplies and preparation process</h2>
<p>To create a wispy lash set, you’ll need a waterproof bonding agent that is semi-permanent. When choosing a bonding agent, always check the ingredients. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK217652/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Latex and formaldehyde can cause irritation</a>. I’ve seen too many swollen eyes to know you should always be careful what you’re putting near your eyes.</p>
<p>You’ll also need non-magnetic tweezers and, of course, the eyelash extensions you’ve selected. Choosing the right tweezers for the job is something you really should consider. For a classic lash extension, 2-SA tweezers do a great job.</p>
<p>When preparing to put on eyelashes or going to a salon for extensions, there are a few things you should be aware of, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all makeup and do not curl your lashes before application.</li>
<li>Make sure <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/eye-cosmetic-safety"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">all your supplies are clean</a> by using soap and water, an alcohol-based product, barbicide, or high heat to sterilize your tools after each use.</li>
<li>If you’re going to a salon, research their reputation, experience, training, and certifications to ensure you’re getting quality service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do you make wispy eyelash extensions?</h2>
<p>When doing eyelash extensions, you’ll first do mapping (which is described below) to know where to put your lash points. The lengths of your lash spikes and where you place them will depend on the shape and length that you want.</p>
<p>After you have laid down the lash spikes, you’ll need to prepare for the filler application. To do this, lightly mist with a nano mister and gently brush the lashes out.</p>
<p>It is easiest to use a handmade lash fan for the filling stage. C curl and D curl lashes are ideal for creating wispy, feathery lashes. Just make sure you are gluing the eyelash extension near the lash line so that the entire lash appears full.</p>
<h2>Wispy lashes styles</h2>
<p>The style of lashes you choose will determine how thick and long your lashes will be and the lash mapping style. Here are the three most common different lashing styles.</p>
<h3>Wispy Classic Lashes</h3>
<p>Classic wispy eyelashes have a 1:1 extension ratio. This ratio means that for every single natural lash you naturally have, you will add one wispy eyelash extension.</p>
<p>Like most lash artists, I recommend classic lash extensions for those who want a natural to medium wispy lash look. Classic lashes aren’t overwhelming; they just extend your natural lashes and fill in gaps.</p>
<h3>Wispy Volume Lashes</h3>
<p>Wispy volume lashes are going to give you the highest density of eyelashes. They have a 1:3+ application ratio.</p>
<p>Wispy volume lash extensions come in a fan shape with two to six eyelash extensions per natural eyelash. Alternating lash lengths create a more natural look.</p>
<h3>Wispy Hybrid Lashes</h3>
<p>Wispy hybrid lash extensions are a combination of the classic and volume look. They have an application ratio of 1:2+.</p>
<p>Hybrid lashes are thicker and denser than classic lashes but don’t have the uniformity of a volume set. I recommend them for fine or gappy eyelashes because they’ll make your lash line look fuller.</p>
<h2>What is the most popular type of eyelash extensions?</h2>
<p>Mink, silk, and synthetics make up most eyelash extensions. Of these, faux mink is the most common option.</p>
<p>As for the three styles of wispy lashes, the classic look is the most popular.</p>
<h2>Wispy lash extension mapping</h2>
<p>To create your own<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ej8ryl_MOE"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""> wispy lash map</a> before application, you’ll need to determine where the lash spikes will go. Your lash spikes mark your highest point, and they will dictate the shape of your extensions.</p>
<div class=""lyte-wrapper"" style=""width:640px;max-width:100%;margin:5px auto;""><div class=""lyMe"" id=""WYL_9ej8ryl_MOE""><div class=""pL"" data-src=""https://www.beautystack.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9ej8ryl_MOE%2Fhqdefault.jpg"" id=""lyte_9ej8ryl_MOE""><div class=""tC""><div class=""tT""></div></div><div class=""play""></div><div class=""ctrl""><div class=""Lctrl""></div><div class=""Rctrl""></div></div></div><noscript><a href=""https://youtu.be/9ej8ryl_MOE"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" height=""340"" src=""https://www.beautystack.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9ej8ryl_MOE%2F0.jpg"" width=""640""/><br/>Watch this video on YouTube</a></noscript></div></div><div class=""lL"" style=""max-width:100%;width:640px;margin:5px auto;""></div>
<p>Usually, they will gradually rise and peak near the center of the eye. They decline in length as you move towards the outer corners of the eye.</p>
<p>The wispy lash mapping style you choose will determine the type of lashes you get. Be sure you’ve already chosen your false strip lashes style before mapping.</p>
<h2>How long do wispy lash extensions last?</h2>
<p>Wispy lash extensions usually last between 2 to 3 weeks. After this time, the lashes will begin to fall off. They will have fallen entirely out between 4 to 6 weeks after application.</p>
<p>The amount of time your extensions will last will also depend on the strength and texture of your natural eyelashes. Where your lashes are in their natural growth cycle when the extensions are applied will also determine how long they stay on.</p>
<h2>How to maintain wispy lash extensions</h2>
<p>To make sure your lashes last as long as possible and don’t break off, follow these simple tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not curl your lash extensions.</li>
<li>If you want to use mascara, only use extension-safe mascara.</li>
<li>Do not rub your eyes. Rubbing can make your extensions fall out or can tangle and twist them.</li>
<li>Face away from the showerhead. The extensions are generally waterproof, but the pressure from the shower can pull them off.</li>
<li>Do not sleep with your eyelashes on your pillow.</li>
<li>Avoid oil-based products near your lashes.</li>
<li>Stay away from chlorinated water.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Do wispy lash extensions ruin your natural lashes?</h2>
<p>The short answer is that wispy lash extensions can ruin your natural lashes if not done correctly <strong>or</strong> if you don’t take care of them.</p>
<p>If your extensions are too heavy for your lashes, they may break off. Talk to a professional lash artist first if you want heavy extensions so they can recommend extensions that are best for you.</p>
<p>When applying your false lashes, make sure you are using the proper adhesive.</p>
<p>The most common adhesive is Ethyl Cyanoacrylate and its fumes and odors can be intense. Certain adhesives containing paraben, ammonia, formaldehyde, lead, and sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate can damage your lashes or even pull out the follicles.</p>
<p>Choosing an adhesive that consists of 100% Alkoxyethyl cyanoacrylate is a comfortable alternative.</p>
<h2>Wispy lash cost analysis</h2>
<p>Below are the costs of wispy lashes in beauty salons in different cities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Los Angeles: $150 to $250</li>
<li>New York City: $140 to $245</li>
<li>Chicago: $275 to $400</li>
<li>Austin: $200 to $350</li>
<li>Atlanta: $295 to $465</li>
<li>Seattle: $100 to $190</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key takeaways on wispy lash extensions</h2>
<p>If you want wispy lashes, you should find the proper tools to apply the lashes that you desire. If you’d rather go to a salon and have the extensions put on professionally, check the rates in your area and make an appointment.</p>
<p>The type of wispy lashes you choose will give you different styles, and the mapping you use will determine the shape of your lashes. Before choosing a set of lashes for application, be sure that they match the style that you want.</p>
<p>You can expect your wispy lash extensions to last for two to three weeks and to fall out by four to six weeks. If you want your lash extensions to last longer, ensure that you care for them properly and follow any safety guidelines.</p>

<p>Are you asking yourself can you put mascara on eyelash extensions? Do you put mascara on fake lashes?</p>
<p>Even after getting eyelash extensions, going without mascara can make us feel naked and old habits die hard. So <strong>can you put mascara on eyelash extensions</strong> or will you ruin your new set?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, you can still enjoy wearing mascara on your <a href=""/lash-extensions/"">lash extensions</a>, as long as you have a classic set.</p>
<p>Classic lash extensions offer a thickness boost to those who already sport pretty decent natural lashes. The final look after classic extensions is similar to what you get with a high-quality mascara.</p>
<p>Volume lash extensions apply multiple lash strands to each natural lash, resulting in a dramatically voluminous look. For those with volume lashes or a hybrid lash (a mix of volume and classic lashes), you’ll have to sit this one out. Mascara may actually hurt your lash extensions, so it’s best to play it safe.</p>
<p>If you’ve got classic lashes and want to continue using mascara, you’re in luck. We’ll go over all the ins and outs of how to safely wear mascara on top of your classic lash extensions. Read on to learn how you can put mascara on lash extensions safely, as well as which mascaras you should use ‒ and what kinds to avoid.</p>
<h2>Mascara vs. eyelash extensions</h2>
<p>If you use a good quality mascara and are handy with an eyelash curler, you might not need anything else to make your eyes pop. The most obvious benefit of using mascara on its own is that you can take it on or off and play with different lash looks.</p>
<p>Eyelash extensions use a special adhesive glue to apply fiber strands to your natural lashes. The benefit of extensions is that you look put together at any time without any effort. You can literally say, “I woke up looking like this.” But, again, you still might be asking can you wear mascara with eyelash extensions.</p>
<h2>Pros and cons of putting mascara on eyelash extensions</h2>
<p>If you opted for classic eyelash extensions, chances are your lash game is already strong. And you probably won’t feel like you need much else on most days.</p>
<p>But, if you have a special occasion you want to look extra glam for, it can be tempting to reach for your trusty old friend ‒ mascara.</p>
<p>Though putting mascara on top of your lash extensions will help you go the extra mile in amping up the drama of your lashes, you have to remember that it isn’t always good for you or your lashes. The main rule is to stay away from any oil-based mascara products and choose a water-based formula instead.</p>
<h2>Types of mascara to wear with lash extensions</h2>
<p>OK, so you decided you can’t live without mascara even after getting your classic lashes. Is there a good mascara eyelash extensions can handle? Here’s a list of the least damaging kinds to use.</p>
<h3>Water-based mascara</h3>
<p>Water-based mascara is the creme de la creme when it comes to mascara for lash extensions. Because it lacks oily and waxy substances (which most mascaras on the market contain), it won’t ruin your lashes or dissolve the bonding agents in your lash glue. Reach for this kind to keep things gentle.</p>
<h3>Oil-free mascara</h3>
<p>Oils also dissolve the glue your lash extensions use to stick to your natural lashes, so avoid it at all costs. When looking at mascara ingredients, make sure there are absolutely no oils listed. If it says oil-free on the package, you found a keeper. Also, watch out for any silicone ingredients.</p>
<h2>Types of mascara to avoid</h2>
<p>Now that you know what’s safe to use with your eyelash extensions, let’s go through the kinds of mascara you should avoid.</p>
<h3>Waterproof mascara</h3>
<p>Waterproof mascara might be a great option when you don’t have lash extensions, but it’s a total nightmare once you do. These mascaras are hard to wash off and contain many ingredients that dissolve your lash glue. This will ultimately make your lashes fall out prematurely. Another key ingredient is silicone, so definitely steer clear of this one.</p>
<h3>Fiber mascara</h3>
<p>Fiber mascaras contain things like silk, nylon, and rayon, which are dry fibers. These fibers make it insanely difficult to remove the product from lashes and will harm your extensions as well as cause them and your natural lashes to fall out. This type of mascara works best on natural lashes.</p>
<h3>Tube mascara</h3>
<p>Don’t let the name confuse you. Tube mascara doesn’t refer to regular mascara that comes in a tube. It gets its name because it uses polymers to individually wrap around each lash, forming tubes. It’s one of the hardest mascara types to remove, and because it forms a tube around each lash, it is definitely unsafe for your lash extensions.</p>
<h2>The right mascara brush</h2>
<p>When it comes to mascara brushes, avoid the kinds that have a harsh grip. Many mascaras spoolies tend to include intricate brush bristles that cling to your lashes because this guarantees a thicker coating on natural lashes. You don’t want that same effect on lash extensions because the tugging and pulling it produces can damage extensions and the natural lashes they’re glued to.</p>
<p>Disposable mascara spoolies, like the kind you get at Ulta to try out different products, are the best kind of brush to use on your extensions. They’re also insanely cheap and easy to come by.</p>
<h2>Lash care while you sleep</h2>
<p>This is a fundamental rule to remember. Never, under any circumstances, wear mascara while you sleep. The risks of eye infection increase exponentially if you wear mascara to bed. Keep in mind that this is true with or without eyelash extensions.</p>
<p>No matter how tired you feel after a long day, don’t skip washing off your makeup. Additionally, lash extensions should be treated with care, and wearing mascara on them through the night could damage them or make them more likely to break off.</p>
<p>Sleeping on your back is the safest choice for reducing any kind of bending or breaking while you sleep. If you’re a side sleeper, try an eye mask that’s designed to cushion and protect your lash extensions. You can also try a silk pillowcase to minimize your lashes snagging in the fabric. If you sleep on your stomach, you’ll end up with lashes on your pillowcase in the morning.</p>
<h2>How to put mascara on eyelash extensions</h2>
<p>Make sure you start with a clean face. Wash your lashes with an eyelash extension cleanser like a foaming shampoo. After your lashes are washed and air-dried, gently comb them with a small lash comb or disposable mascara spoolie. Avoid pulling or tugging.</p>
<p>Have your water-based or oil-free formula ready and apply it to your lash extensions with the same motion you would to your natural lashes, but avoid the base. Only apply the product from the middle of your lashes to the tips.</p>
<h2>Can you put mascara on bottom lashes?</h2>
<p>Though it isn’t as common as only doing top lash extensions, it is possible to get eyelash extensions on your top and bottom lashes. It’s considered an advanced practice, so not all lash technicians do it.</p>
<p>That being said, if you have lash extensions on the bottom, follow the same protocol as for top lash extensions. Don’t use any mascara that has oils, silicones, or fibers. If your bottom lashes are natural, this is less of an issue, but stick to a water-based or oil-free formula just to be safe.</p>
<h2>How to remove mascara from eyelash extensions</h2>
<p>Gentleness is key.</p>
<p>Use an oil-free makeup remover. The main ingredient in water-based makeup removers is surfactant, which removes makeup particles from the outer layer.</p>
<p>The applicator you use with your makeup remover should also be lint-free and non-sticky. A smooth washcloth or brush can work well, just be sure not to rub your eyes or tug on your lashes. Instead, use patting motions.</p>
<h2>Additional do’s and don’ts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do clean your makeup tools regularly. Any time you deal with lashes or makeup, hygiene is crucial. Especially when adding mascara to the mix, you have to be careful not to use contaminated tools.</li>
<li>Don’t ever share your mascara. When you share products, you risk catching an infection or harmful germs from someone else.</li>
<li>Don’t pump your mascara wand up and down inside the tube. This pushes air into the tube, which makes your product clump and dry up faster.</li>
<li>Do avoid touching your lash extensions. You don’t want to accidentally ruin them, so keep your hands off your face as much as possible.</li>
<li>Don’t take scorching hot showers, the humidity can ruin your extensions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaways on wearing mascara with lashes</h2>
<p>If you splurged on eyelash extensions, you don’t need to wear mascara. Your lashes will look great without it, and you can get away with fewer makeup products in general. But, if you just can’t break the habit or simply want to add more drama, putting mascara on eyelash extensions is possible as long as you follow proper protocol.</p>
<p>Keep things clean, always be gentle, and use the right tools. Most importantly, be sure to never use any waterproof products on your lash extensions or anything that contains fibers and oils. Stick with water-based and oil-free only.</p>
<p>Can you put mascara on lash extensions? Definitely yes, and now that you know the right way, go out and amp up your lash look by getting an extension-friendly mascara.</p>

<p>Is there anything more disturbing than dirty eyelash extensions? With time lash extensions develop a buildup of unsightly makeup debris, dead skin, oil buildup, and dirt.</p>
<p>Do you know how to clean eyelash extensions or how to take care of eyelash extensions?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people don’t know how to clean them without ruining them. But, you can do a lash cleanse twice a day, using a soft brush, eyelash cleanser, and clean water without damaging them.</p>
<p>Being a makeup artist for over six years, I learned that the foolproof way to make your falsies last longer is by washing them.</p>
<p>I have met with lots of clients who come in for a lash refill with dirty lashes. This is because most people think cleaning eyelash extensions can damage the adhesive. The truth is that the bond lasts longer when lashes are clear of dirt and makeup residue.</p>
<p>Cleaning lashes can extend their life and prevent infections. If you are not washing your extensions, it means bacteria will continue to build up and end up in your eyes.</p>

<p>Oil, dirt, and makeup result in <a href=""https://www.aoa.org/healthy-eyes/eye-and-vision-conditions/blepharitis?sso=y"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">crusty buildup</a> if not cleaned. The major challenge lash extension experts face is managing client aftercare and hygiene.</p>
<p>A strict lash cleansing routine is vital. If you are not washing your extensions, bacteria will stick to your eyes and cause infections.</p>
<p>Clean lashes last longer: love your lashes, and they will love you back. Improper cleaning has similar consequences with neglecting the lash extensions: irritation, poor lash growth, and infections.</p>
<h2 id=""what-happens-if-you-don-t-clean-lash-extensions"">What happens if you don’t clean lash extensions?</h2>
<p>Failure to wash your lash extensions will result in blepharitis and <a href=""https://missouripoisoncenter.org/the-risks-of-eyelash-glue-for-extensions/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">glue bond breakage</a>.</p>
<p>Blepharitis is a result of bacterial overgrowth along the eyelashes base. This creates an environment where mites thrive, causing inflammation of the eyelids.</p>
<p>Buildup breaks down the extensions’ adhesive bond. When the glue gets weak, the lash extensions start to fall off prematurely. An effect that’s as undesired as it is short-lasting.</p>
<p>Regular cleaning will ensure your lashes stay intact, lush, and full. Use a good eyelash extension wash to clean your falsies twice a day, in the morning and evening.</p>

<h3 id=""use-an-oil-free-makeup-remover-first"">Use an oil-free makeup remover first</h3>
<p>Use an oil-free makeup remover or cleanser for cleaning lash extensions. Gently sweep away debris, makeup residue, dirt, and oils. Most oils will weaken the eyelash extensions’ adhesive bond, and they will start to fall off.</p>

<h3 id=""foaming-cleanser"">Foaming cleanser</h3>
<p>Foaming lash extension cleanser will rinse out completely. They don’t leave residue on your lashes. In addition, they don’t weaken the adhesive bond, and their formula boosts lash health.</p>

<h2 id=""can-i-use-baby-shampoo-to-clean-eyelash-extensions"">Can I use baby shampoo to clean eyelash extensions?</h2>
<p>Baby shampoo can clear impurities, dirt, and oil from your lash extensions. However, it is not recommended as baby shampoos have perfumes that will irritate your eyes.</p>
<p>The sulfates and oils in the shampoo will also weaken the glue and cause the extensions to fall off.</p>
<h2 id=""when-to-clean-eyelash-extensions"">When to clean eyelash extensions</h2>
<p>Some lash technicians recommend lash cleansing about three times a week. However, cleaning twice a day is recommended, especially if you wear makeup and have oily skin.</p>
<p>Cleaning at night will get rid of the day’s dust, oils, and makeup buildup.</p>
<p>Extensions must be cleaned after activities like exercise and swimming. Sweat, chlorine, salt, and oil undermine the integrity of the adhesive bond. You must remove them immediately to maintain the strength of the bond.</p>
<p>You should not clean eyelash extensions within the first 48 hours of application.</p>
