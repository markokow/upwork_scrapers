<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What-is-a-lash-lift""></span>What is a lash lift?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Imagine waking up every day with your lashes looking like you just used the best quality mascara and expertly curled your lashes.</p>
<p><a href=""/what-is-a-lash-lift-and-how-long-do-they-last/"">Lash lifts</a> are an easy treatment that reduces your make-up time and ensures you still look great after doing the bare minimum.</p>
<p>A lash lift is more like giving your eyelashes a permanent curl. The technique aims to increase the curl of your natural lashes while helping them appear longer and fuller. By changing the shape of your lashes your eyes look more open and alert look.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""10-best-lash-lift-kits""></span>10 best lash lift kits<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>

<p>My top eyelash perm kit has to be this <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0976SXTLS?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=0ac055cebab3945732d49d7243db678a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">42pcs kit by Clione Prime</a>. There is everything to love about the Cruelty-free kit since it doesn’t break your natural lashes. The setting solution of this product seals your eyelashes perfectly to take you through up to 8 weeks without retouching.</p>
<p>This kit from Clione is made with sustainability in mind. It features one-time-use sachets that are sealed to ensure freshness. You only use one sachet each time you wish to do eyelash perm, thus eliminating wastage.</p>
<p>You will love that the eyelash perming solution comes with silicone rods in different sizes, so you can select the best depending on the look you want to achieve.</p>
<p>The one downside of the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0976SXTLS?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=0ac055cebab3945732d49d7243db678a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Clione Cruelty-free kit</a> is that it has an odor. Although not overwhelming, it can be a turn-off to some users.</p>

<p>The second on my list is <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0857L5HBX?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=aba072f14f517180a3214de67b6985a2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Lash Stuff’s Lash Lift Kit With </strong><strong>Keratin</strong></a>. As the name suggests, this <a href=""/keratin-lash-infusion/"">keratin lash lift</a> kit is made for professionals. Don’t attempt to use it at home if you lack a professional license, as you risk damaging your lashes. The product is a 20 applications kit. It comes in sachets, each for one use to reduce wastage.</p>
<p>Lash Lift Kit With Keratin is everything you need to achieve strong curls without compromising the quality of your natural lashes. The product doesn’t contain any harsh elements, making it ideal for all skin types. With proper application, this professional keratin kit can last up to eight weeks without retouch.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that this eyelash lift kit is only meant for beauty professionals, the other drawback is the setting solutions take longer to show results.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""3-Best-budget-Silksence-Lash-Lift-Kits""></span>3. Best budget: Silksence Lash Lift Kits<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>Silksence perm solution is the best choice for anyone on a tight budget. It is quite affordable, and the results are worth every penny. This eyelash perming kit contains quality ingredients to obtain long-lasting eyelash curl effects.</p>
<p>With proper application and maintenance, the extra curl from this kit can last you for a month. This benefit makes the kit ideal if you only want to enhance your lashes for an upcoming party or event, such as a wedding, and go back to your natural lashes afterward.</p>
<p>This large eyelash lift kit is extremely economical and easy to use. Although it is primarily meant for professionals, you can use it for at-home lash lifting.</p>
<p>However, the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMSG5YD?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=df92ac0f1407edb73a65f14b71362798&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Silksence Eyelash lift kit</strong></a> is a bit harsh on the skin. You may experience a tingling or burning effect after use. I recommend that you avoid it if you are a beginner.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""4-Vassoul-Lash-Lift-Kits""></span>4. Vassoul Lash Lift Kits<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>

<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""5-Lomansa-Permamia-Lash-Perm-Kit""></span>5. Lomansa Permamia Lash Perm Kit<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>What I loved most about <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0827MWVNP?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=cd2bfebaf76f5e5cf7b2ebd246591944&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the Lomansa Permamia kit</a> was its easy usability. The product is a three-step lash lift, featuring a lash perming lotion, lash setting lotion, and lash essence enhancing. By the end of the three steps, you should achieve well-defined curls.</p>
<p>Even better, the kit comes with a lash lifting adhesive. It is water-soluble making it ideal for both beginners and novice users. You will love that the eyelash perm has a Keratin boost to protect, thicken and strengthen your natural lashes.</p>
<p>The only drawback of the Lomansa Permamia lash lift is that the curls do not last long.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""6-Ayasal-Luxury-Lash-Lift""></span>6. Ayasal Luxury Lash Lift<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>I’m a perfectionist, and this character extends to my make-up. I would rather spend hours fixing the tiniest detail than leave the house in doubt. The <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M2HRV2W?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=d0dfcbef0bfe7c185398db1eec11b838&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ayasal Luxury Lash Kit</a> got my attention due to the range of products per kit.</p>
<p>The eyelash lift kit has everything you need for a complete glam look. It’s an all-in-one kit to laminate your lashes and give them natural curls to last for a month.</p>
<p>The manufacturers made sure you get everything you need for an easy and safe application. These include a lifting cream, moisturizer, neutralizing lotion, lash glue, brushes, under-eye gel patches, and silicon pads.</p>
<p>All the products use a gentle formula to avoid irritation around the eyes. The product is one of the best at-home lash lift kits but can also be used in beauty spas. You can use it up to five times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the eyelash curler does not come with a manual, and the application procedure can be confusing to first-time users.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""7-Elevate-Lash-Lamination""></span>7. Elevate Lash Lamination<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>Elevate Lash Lamination is one of the most common home lash lift kits. It’s not surprising why, as the kit works very fast. With the 2 in 1 lash lamination kit, you get longer, fuller, and remain curled for up to 8 weeks.</p>
<p>Besides perming your lashes, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Elevate-Beauty-Eyebrow-Lamination-Professional/dp/B07YX66BD3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=lash+lift+kit&amp;qid=1633725132&amp;sr=8-41&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=82bd52e710785ae05f3e07f2a511439c&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Elevate Lash Lamination</a> is perfect for redesigning your brows to make them look fuller and bushier. The kit reduces your overall make-up time and saves you money.</p>
<p>This kit is suitable for individuals with messy eyebrows and short lashes. It’s a perfect DIY at-home lash lift and eyebrow lamination.</p>
<p>The only downside I noticed about this product is its smell which is quite unpleasant.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""8-Libeauty-Lash-Perm-and-Tint-Kit""></span>8. Libeauty Lash Perm and Tint Kit<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>

<p>It is an excellent fixation solution for beginners who wish to try lash lifting at home. The perm lotion is easy to use and remove. They feature a gentle formula to ensure minimum irritation and burning sensation. Moreover, the big eyelash perm kit is economical thus, helping you save money. You will notice a huge difference in the volume and shade of your lashes at once, while it takes just a few strokes to get visible results.</p>
<p>The downside is that the eyelash perming solution comes with a ton of unlabeled products and no manual.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""9-QJWm""></span>9. QJWm<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>

The kit is made with every user’s best interest at heart. The product comes in one-use sachets to avoid waste and facilitate hygiene through the lash lift process.</p>
<p>The <strong>eyelash lift kit</strong> seals your natural lashes to protect them from breaking. You will have curly lashes for up to 8 weeks without the need to wear mascara or extensions. The perm kit acts as a sealant for your lash to keep them nourished and hydrated.</p>
<p>Perm kit comes with a silicone pad and rods that help you perm your lashes from the roots. The rods are in different sizes for different eye shapes to help you straighten the lashes during the perming process.</p>
<p>Based on the reviews and ratings on this product, the only disadvantage is that sticking the silicon pad on the lashes is quite a challenge.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""10-Dollys-Eyelash-Wave-Lotion""></span>10. Dolly’s Eyelash Wave Lotion<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>The first thing that caught my attention about <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dollys-Eye-Lash-Wave-Lotion/dp/B008RN1QQO?dchild=1&amp;keywords=lash+perm+kit&amp;qid=1633727040&amp;s=beauty&amp;sr=1-22&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=beautystack-20&amp;linkId=1f612e0a762dcf50e8e803a01a1175b0&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dolly’s Eyelash Wave Lotion</a> is how well each bottle is labeled. You will know which step to do and what follows to lift lashes. In my opinion, this is the most beginner-friendly kit to try out. The lash kit makes it easy even for beginner beauty noobs to do a DIY lash lift, which helps them save the cost at the salon.</p>
<p>You can count on this kit for impressive results, even with stubborn lashes.</p>
<p>The only drawback is it lacks an instruction manual, but you can always check out YouTube videos like this for guidance.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Lash-lift-kit-buying-guide""></span>Lash lift kit buying guide<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>With the above list of top DIY lash lifts to try out, you will have an easier time selecting the most favorable. Remember, what works for me may not work for you. You have a range of factors to consider when purchasing the best lash lift kits, as discussed below:</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Your-budget""></span>Your budget<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>How much can you comfortably spend on a lash perming kit? Setting a budget will help narrow down your search. You can do away with the kits beyond your financial capacity and remain with a few that fits your budget.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Whats-in-the-kit""></span>What’s in the kit<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>An ideal kit should have everything you need for an easy application process. These include lift pads, rods, and an instruction manual. It will also help if you choose a kit with one-time use sachets to avoid product wastage.</p>
<h3><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Special-occasions""></span>Special occasions<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<p>How and when do you intend to use the kit? Suppose you want to lift your lashes for a one-time event. You can choose a lift kit with a short-lasting period. On the other hand, if you want to have your lashes curled every day, perhaps for work or school, go for a kit that offers the longest-lasting results to save money.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Will-a-lash-lift-destroy-my-lashes""></span>Will a lash lift destroy my lashes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>No, lash lifts won’t destroy your lashes. You may experience negative results if you use the wrong silicone pads and use a poor-quality kit.</p>
<p>In addition, over-processing can damage your natural lashes and lead to breakage, so it’s important to always be fully informed about the process of performing your own lash lift.</p>
<p>Avoid rubbing your eyes after a lash lift as your natural lashes can be more prone to breakage.</p>
<p>To keep your lashes healthy and minimize breakage, follow these <a href=""/5-simple-rules-for-lash-lift-aftercare/"">5 Simple Rules of Lash Lift Aftercare</a>.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is-it-safe-to-DIY-a-lash-lift-at-home""></span>Is it safe to DIY a lash lift at home?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>While it’s best to have a professional lash lift, if you do your homework it is safe to do your own lash lift at home.</p>
<p>My advice, take your time preparing for your lash lift by watching as many YouTube tutorials as you can before rushing to apply the products. Check out this video for a comprehensive guide.</p>
<div class=""lyte-wrapper"" style=""width:640px;max-width:100%;margin:5px auto;""><div class=""lyMe"" id=""WYL_Im0uzbM_C-U""><div class=""pL"" data-src=""https://www.beautystack.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIm0uzbM_C-U%2Fhqdefault.jpg"" id=""lyte_Im0uzbM_C-U""><div class=""tC""><div class=""tT""></div></div><div class=""play""></div><div class=""ctrl""><div class=""Lctrl""></div><div class=""Rctrl""></div></div></div><noscript><a href=""https://youtu.be/Im0uzbM_C-U"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" height=""340"" src=""https://www.beautystack.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIm0uzbM_C-U%2F0.jpg"" width=""640""/><br/>Watch this video on YouTube</a></noscript></div></div><div class=""lL"" style=""max-width:100%;width:640px;margin:5px auto;""></div>
<p>If you accidentally over-process your lash lift by letting the developer sit too long, read this article on <a href=""/oil-to-relax-lash-lift/"">How to Use Oil to Relax Your Lash Lift</a>.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Lash-lift-vs-lash-perm-whats-the-difference""></span>Lash lift vs lash perm, what’s the difference?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The difference is not only highlighted in their names, but also in how they are applied. The former lifts your lashes from the base utilizing silicone pads to make them appear longer while eyelash perm gives your lashes extra curl by using rods.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Final-thoughts-on-lash-lift-kits""></span>Final thoughts on lash lift kits<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The best eyelash lift kit depends on your specific needs. While the reviewed kits made it to the top 10 list, my favorite for at-home lash lift is Dolly’s Eyelash wave lotion.</p>

<p><strong>Classic eyelash extensions vs hybrid vs volume lash extensions, what’s the difference?</strong> Each lash type is unique and varies depending on the materials and volume of lashes used in the process.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> eyelash extensions look the most natural and are <em>good for everyday wear</em>.</li><li><strong>Hybrid</strong> lashes combine classic and volume extensions <em>for a thicker everyday look</em>.</li><li><strong>Volume</strong> extensions are extremely dense and are popular <em>for special occasions</em>.</li></ul>
<p>I’ve tried <a href=""/lash-extensions/"">all three eyelash extension types</a> multiple times, so I have a good grasp of the differences to guide you in selecting the best lash for you. I’ll compare the three different kinds and when to use each one. And I’ll also answer some questions I had when I was an extension newbie.</p>

<h2 id=""what-are-classic-lash-extensions""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What-are-classic-lash-extensions""></span>What are classic lash extensions?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p><em>Ratio:</em> 1:1<br/><em>Common diameters:</em> 0.15 mm, 0.18 mm, and 0.20 mm</p>
<p>Classic eyelash extensions are perfect for everyday wear because they look natural and aren’t overly dramatic or distracting.</p>
<p>If you already have a lot of lashes but just need more length, classic lashes can help. They can also replace regular mascara.</p>
<p>For each natural eyelash you have, one false eyelash is applied. Because of this 1:1 ratio, they are thicker than the ones used for volume.</p>
<h2 id=""what-are-hybrid-lash-extensions""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What-are-hybrid-lash-extensions""></span>What are hybrid lash extensions?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p><em>Ratio:</em> 1:2 to 1:10<br/><em>Common diameters:</em> 0.06mm &amp; 0.07mm</p>
<p>Hybrid eyelash extensions combine classic and volume techniques into one. This type of lash extension is helpful if you have sparse lashes and need extra volume to fill in the gaps. It provides the length of classic lashes with the volume of volume lashes.</p>
<p>The extensions are more texturized and more dense in hybrid lashes vs classic lashes. However, they have a less uniform look than volume extensions.</p>
<p>Hybrid extensions include 30% classic lash extensions and 70% volume lash extensions. The ratio for volume lashes is between 1:2 and 1:10.</p>

<h2 id=""what-are-volume-lash-extensions""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What-are-volume-lash-extensions""></span>What are volume lash extensions?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p><em>Ratio:</em> up to 6:1<br/><em>Common diameters:</em> 0.03mm, 0.05mm, and 0.07mm</p>
<p>Volume lashes are all about creating lush, full lashes. While they don’t increase length as much as classic lashes, they work great for creating a fuller look if you have sparse lashes.</p>
<p>These are dramatic out-on-the-town or I’ve-got-a-hot-date lashes. If you don’t normally have sparse lashes, they may be a bit much for an everyday look.</p>
<p>At 0.03mm, 0.05mm, and 0.07mm, the diameter is smaller than classic lashes because the volume comes from lash quantity. The lash artist will place 2-6 volume lash extensions on top of each natural lash for a ratio of up to 6:1. You’ll hear them called 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d, or 6d extensions based on the number of lashes.</p>

<p>The best type of lash for you depends on your lash goals. </p>

<h3 id=""pick-hybrid-lashes-if""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Pick-hybrid-lashes-if""></span>Pick hybrid lashes if:<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>
<ul><li>You want <strong>more texture and volume than classic lashes but less than volume lashes</strong></li><li>You want a <strong>lusher everyday look</strong> for work or home</li><li>You want a fuller look than classic lashes to <strong>fill in empty gaps</strong></li><li>If you want a <strong>less uniform</strong>, <strong>more lifelike</strong> look than volume lashes</li></ul>
<h3 id=""pick-volume-lashes-if""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Pick-volume-lashes-if""></span>Pick volume lashes if:<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h3>

<h2 id=""are-volume-lashes-the-same-as-cluster-lashes""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Are-volume-lashes-the-same-as-cluster-lashes""></span>Are volume lashes the same as cluster lashes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>In a word, no. </p>
<p>Cluster lashes are pre-made fans known as clusters. Volume lashes are very light individual faux mink lash hairs that get placed on each lash.</p>
<p>Cluster lashes are often heavier, and they aren’t as customization-friendly as volume sets. Additionally, cluster lashes can cause you to lose your natural lash if you get them too frequently because of the heavy amounts of glue used.</p>
<p>Having clusters instead of individual lashes also prevents your natural lash from growing out as it should.</p>
<p>I once had a bad experience getting cluster lashes when I thought I was getting volume lashes. They ended up pulling my natural lashes off when they fell off, which left me with shorter and fewer lashes.</p>

<p>Classic eyelash extensions last about <strong>4-6 weeks</strong>. The actual amount of time depends on each person’s natural growth cycle. Extensions will fall out with your natural lashes as they grow out as well.</p>
<p>Hybrid and volume extensions last the same amount of time as classic extensions.</p>

<p>As tempting as it may seem, don’t cheap out when it comes to eyelash extensions! You pay for what you get. If you want well-done and pretty lashes, expect to pay a bit more. </p>
<p>Volume and hybrid lashes often cost more than a classic set of lashes due to the number of materials used.</p>
<p>In the past, I have spent about $200 per classic eyelash extension set, with a touch-up fee of about $50-$70. </p>
<pre class=""wp-block-preformatted""><em>You can read more detail about cost here -&gt;<strong> </strong></em><a data-id=""259"" data-type=""post"" href=""https://www.beautystack.com/how-much-do-lash-extensions-cost/""> </a><a data-id=""259"" data-type=""post"" href=""https://www.beautystack.com/how-much-do-lash-extensions-cost/"">How much do lash extensions cost?</a></pre>
<p>Cost varies from city to city and studio to studio. Cost is dependent upon the materials used, the lash artists’ experience, and the use of their time. Check the prices in your area when you research salons for lash extensions.</p>
<h2 id=""do-i-have-to-get-a-new-set-every-time""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do-I-have-to-get-a-new-set-every-time""></span>Do I have to get a new set every time?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>New, full sets of eyelash extensions are often <strong>only applied once</strong> unless you let your eyelash extensions grow out and do not go back for a touch-up. If you let them grow out, you will need to get a new full set.</p>
<p>If you enjoy the way that your eyelash extensions look, a touch-up every 4-6 weeks will cost you less and will keep your eyelash extensions looking nice and full.</p>
<h2 id=""do-i-need-to-wear-mascara-if-i-have-lash-extensions""><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do-I-need-to-wear-mascara-if-I-have-lash-extensions""></span>Do I need to wear mascara if I have lash extensions?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>No! That is one of the best parts of having lash extensions. Classic lashes are the closest thing to natural lashes, but you still do not need mascara with them. The darkness and lift you get from mascara is the result you get from classic lashes.</p>
<p>While <a href=""/can-you-put-mascara-on-eyelash-extensions/"">you can use mascara on classic lash extensions</a>, it’s best to skip the mascara altogether. <em>If you have hybrid or volume extensions, definitely avoid mascara.</em> Not only will mascara harden delicate extensions, removing it will break down the adhesive or pull out the lash extensions and your natural lash.</p>

<p>Yes, you can go up from classic lash extensions to volume lashes. It will take more time and money to go backward.</p>
<p>If you are not sure if you want the lash fullness of volume or hybrid lashes, start with a classic set. Once you know that you want more volume, go in to increase the fullness at your next appointment!</p>

<p>Classic eyelash extensions can be a wise first extension choice since they’re lighter on your eyes. You can see how you like how they look and feel to determine if you want to go for a little more volume with a hybrid lash or a lot more volume with a volume lash.</p>
<p>Lash extensions may look intimidating, but now you know the difference between classic vs hybrid lashes and hybrid vs volume lashes and what to expect from them. Make the first move toward having the eyelashes you’ve always wanted by setting up an appointment with a lash stylist today.</p>

Great for sensitive skin, your lashes not only get clean, but your eyes get healthier in the process. Understanding that the skin around the eye is delicate, this optometrist-formulated cleanser includes a probiotic, plant-based preservative system that helps maintain eyelid health.</p>

<p>Cleaning your face when <a href=""/lash-extensions/"">you have eyelash extensions</a> can seem like a challenge, but once you understand how to do it right, you keep your eyes healthier and help your lash extensions to last longer. </p>
<p>In this section, I go over the basic steps as well as some important tips to keep those lashes looking lovely for a long time.</p>
<p>To give your eyelash extensions a lash bath, follow these basic steps:</p>
<ul><li>Rinse with water</li><li>Apply cleanser</li><li>Gently rub the cleanser through your lashes</li><li>Rinse with water</li><li>Fan your lashes dry</li><li>Gently brush your lashes</li></ul>
<p>What you clean your lashes with, as well as what tools you use, can mean the difference between losing lashes and keeping them intact longer. To understand what to use to get the most out of your extensions, make sure you follow the tips on how to clean your lashes.</p>
<h3 id=""use-an-eyelash-extension-cleanser"">Use an eyelash extension cleanser</h3>
<p>Rather than risk weakening the glue on your extensions, make sure you use the right products to wash your lashes to keep them healthy and help them to last longer. You need to use a product formulated to be an eyelash extension cleanser or shampoo to properly clean your lashes without the risk of damaging the glue.</p>
<h3 id=""gently-rub-with-the-right-rools"">Gently rub with the right rools</h3>
<p>You can not be in a hurry to clean your eyelash extensions. Many cleansers come with a brush or tool. After you pump cleanser onto your eyelids and lashes, you can use that brush to gently–<em>very gently</em>–work the cleanser through your lashes.</p>
<h3 id=""brush-your-lashes"">Brush your lashes</h3>
<p>After you clean and dry your lash extensions, use a clean mascara brush to gently brush your lashes back into shape. You only need to brush through them a few times to get them back into shape. </p>
<p>Even if you haven’t cleaned your eyelash extensions, you should always brush them in the morning and before bed to tame misshapen lashes and separate them.</p>
<h3 id=""can-you-use-micellar-cleansing-water-for-cleaning-eyelash-extensions"">Can you use micellar cleansing water for cleaning eyelash extensions?</h3>
<p>In short, the answer is yes. But before you do,  first understand what micellar water is and how it affects your lashes before you choose to use micellar water for cleaning your eyelash extensions.</p>
<p>Bioderma invented micellar water in 1991 and completely changed how people cleanse their faces. The micelles, little balls of cleansers floating in water, pick up dirt and oils without damaging skin. </p>
<p>Many people use micellar water to clean makeup from their faces, and those with sensitive skin have found micellar water to be gentle enough to wash with twice daily.</p>
<p>Because micellar water effectively cleans makeup, many people want to use it to cleanse their eyelash extensions. But you must be careful. </p>
<p>You have to be sure you use a <em>water-based formula</em> and not one containing any oil. Oil breaks down the glue used as the adhesive bond for your lash extensions. So using an oil-based formula damages your extensions.</p>
<p>You might also consider that micellar water, while safe for removing makeup, may not be specially formulated to clean lash extensions as well as cleansers made specifically for that purpose. But micellar water can safely clean your lash extensions as long as it is oil-free.</p>
<p>Avoid rubbing your lash extensions too hard or cleansing too often to keep your eyelash extensions looking their best and lasting their longest.</p>
<h2 id=""key-points-on-eyelash-extension-cleansers"">Key points on eyelash extension cleansers</h2>
