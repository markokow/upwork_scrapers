Decreasing the pH of enzyme solution below this range results in a decrease in enzyme activity.</b>,Does pH affect amylase activity?,The optimum pH for the reaction of starch with amylase is pH 7.

These are useful tools to quickly describe a location's climate.</b>,What is the biome with the lowest temperature?,tundra,What type of biome would you expect to find in a region that has temperate temperatures & a medium amount of precipitation?,"<b>Temperate Forests</b> A temperate climate is a moderate climate that is neither extremely hot nor extremely cold. A temperate climate can be either continental or coastal. Continental temperate climates are found inland, and they tend to have cold winters, hot summers, and moderate precipitation.",What biome has low temperatures and low amounts of rainfall?,"ABWhich biome is characterized by very low temperatures, little precipitation, and permafrost?<b>Tundra</b>Which two biomes have the least amount of precipitation?Desert and tundraA biome is identified by its particular set of abiotic factors and its ___.characteristic plant and animal communities27 more rows",What biome would the climate be cold and dry?,"<b>Boreal forests are also found above a certain elevation (and below high elevations where trees cannot grow) in mountain ranges throughout the Northern Hemisphere. This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers.</b>",What shows the average temperature and precipitation?,<b>A climograph is a graphical representation of a location's basic climate. Climographs display data for two variables: (a) monthly average temperature and (b) monthly average precipitation. These are useful tools to quickly describe a location's climate.</b>,How do you find the average temperature in a year?,"Calculate the average of the 12 mean monthly temperatures. Add the mean monthly temperatures for the months of the calendar year, January to December, together, <b>and then divide by 12. This will be the mean annual temperature.</b>",What do temperature and precipitation determine in an area?,"Differences in temperature or precipitation determine <b>the types of plants that grow in a given area (Figure 1). Generally speaking, height, density, and species diversity decreases from warm, wet climates to cool, dry climates.  Regions of similar climate and dominant plant types are called biomes.</b>",Which climate has high year round temperatures and year round precipitation?,Tropical climates,What biome is most likely encountered at any latitude?,"<b>Temperate forests are found at higher latitudes and experience all four seasons. Boreal forests are found at even higher latitudes, and have the coldest and driest climate, where precipitation occurs primarily in the form of snow. Deserts are dry areas where rainfall is less than 50 centimeters (20 inches) per year.</b>"
