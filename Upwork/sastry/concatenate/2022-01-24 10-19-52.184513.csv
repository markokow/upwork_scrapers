Heavy cream works well to give vanilla ice cream a rich flavor but may take away from the flavor of other ingredients when adding flavorings.</b>,What is the secret to creamy ice cream?,"Most premium ice creams use <b>14 percent milk fat.

556,Is iced coffee stronger than a latte?,"<b>An iced latte is not stronger than iced coffee because it has a more balanced and mellow taste because of the amount of milk added.

Iced coffee is regular hot coffee served over ice, so it can quickly become diluted. Because of this, an equal amount of cold brew coffee will have more caffeine than iced coffee because it is not as diluted.</b>",Does iced coffee hit you faster?,My personal experience is that cold brewed coffee has more caffeine than most coffee brewed the standard hot method. So <b>less cold brew gives me a caffeine kick very quickly and I have to be careful and drink much less of it or I get very wired with a bad crash.</b>,Is iced coffee more powerful?,"So is cold brew coffee stronger than hot coffee? The answer is that it really can be a case-by-case basis. Generally, <b>cold brew does have more caffeine than hot coffee  thanks to a higher coffee-to-water ratio in the brewing stage  but this can change based on how everything is mixed.</b>",Does iced coffee give you more energy?,"Metabolism is the process by which your body uses food to create energy. The higher your metabolic rate, the more calories you burn at rest. Just like hot coffee, cold brew coffee contains caffeine, which has been shown to <b>increase your resting metabolic rate by up to 11% ( 1 , 2 ).</b>",Is iced coffee worse than hot coffee?,"Iced coffee, particularly cold brew, <b>is less acidic than hot coffee. 67 per cent less, in fact, which makes it better for your stomach and teeth. The acidity in coffee is what makes it bitter, so by having less, iced coffee is both healthier and more flavourful.</b>"
