The release is part of work in progress to support newer features in the MongoDB 4.0 upcoming release and make some other API changes.</p>\n<p>One such change triggering the current warning is the <code>useNewUrlParser</code> option, due to some changes around how passing the connection URI actually works. More on that later.</p>\n<p>Until things settle down, it would probably be <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/22345808/2313887>advisable to pin</a> at least to the minor version for <code>3.0.x</code> releases:</p>\n<pre><code>  dependencies: {\n    mongodb: ~3.0.8\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>That should stop the <code>3.1.x</code> branch being installed on fresh installations to node modules. If you already did install a latest release which is the beta version, then you should clean up your packages ( and <code>package-lock.json</code> ) and make sure you bump that down to a <code>3.0.x</code> series release.</p>\n<p>As for actually using the new connection URI options, the main restriction is to actually include the <code>port</code> on the connection string:</p>\n<pre><code>const { MongoClient } = require(mongodb);\nconst uri = mongodb://localhost:27017;  // mongodb://localhost - will fail\n\n(async function() {\n  try {\n\n    const client = await MongoClient.connect(uri,{ useNewUrlParser: true });\n    // ... anything\n\n    client.close();\n  } catch(e) {\n    console.error(e)\n  }\n\n})()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thats a more strict rule in the new code. The main point being that the current code is essentially part of the node-native-driver ( npm <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb rel=noreferrer><code>mongodb</code></a> ) repository code, and the new code actually imports from the <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-core rel=noreferrer><code>mongodb-core</code></a> library which underpins the public node driver.</p>\n<p>The point of the option being added is to ease the transition by adding the option to new code so the newer parser ( actually based around <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/url rel=noreferrer><code>url</code></a> ) is being used in code adding the option and clearing the deprecation warning, and therefore verifying that your connection strings passed in actually comply with what the new parser is expecting.</p>\n<p>In future releases the legacy parser would be removed and then the new parser will simply be what is used even without the option. But by that time, it is expected that all existing code had ample opportunity to test their existing connection strings against what the new parser is expecting.</p>\n<p>So if you want to start using new driver features as they are released, then use the available <code>beta</code> and subsequent releases and ideally make sure you are providing a connection string which is valid for the new parser by enabling the <code>useNewUrlParser</code> option in <code>MongoClient.connect()</code>.</p>\n<p>If you dont actually need access to features related to preview of the MongoDB 4.0 release, then pin the version to a <code>3.0.x</code> series as noted earlier. This will work as documented and pinning this ensures that <code>3.1.x</code> releases are not updated over the expected dependency until you actually want to install a stable version.</p>'","b'<p>The below highlighted code to the mongoose connection solved the warning for the mongoose driver:</p>\n<pre><code>mongoose.connect(mongodb://localhost:27017/test, { useNewUrlParser: true });\n</code></pre>'"

Swing layouts were developed so that the components are placed in a specific order. If you manipulate the values \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bof dimensions and positioning of components, you will be breaking the functionality of the layouts, and your program is likely to behave in strange ways. Ive had cases where I developed an application in Swing without the use of layout. In an operating system, my program seemed to work properly, but porting it to other systems, everything went into disarray. Therefore, you need to stay tuned and perform many tests before launching an application in Swing that has such customizations.</p>\n<p>This was one reason that the JavaFX technology came into our hands. With such technology, we can concern ourselves with less stuff (deploy the application in different programs) and do much more (including the one youre having trouble).

If you dont want to download the demo, you can also find <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oKPhXSH0ZI rel=nofollow noreferrer>videos</a> on the internet that demonstrate how it works.</p>\n<p>If this alternative is too laborious for you, check out the link I gave you about the Timing Framework library. There you will find examples of Java code that make smooth animations on various Swing things with a high performance. To learn how to use this library, I suggest you to get the book <a href=http://filthyrichclients.org/ rel=nofollow noreferrer>Filthy Rich Clients</a>, written by Chet Haase and Romain Guy.

In this case, we need only perform the subtraction where the two inputs are either both negative or both non-negative. This avoids the arithmetic overflow condition.</p>\n<p>Since the size of <code>int</code> strictly speaking is unknown at run time, we use <code>std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()</code> as a convenient mask for the value bits. The mask of the sign bit is simply the bit-wise negation of the value bits.</p>\n<p>Turning to the actual expression for <code>&lt;=</code>, we factor out the bit-wise mask <code>sm</code> of the sign bit in each of the sub-expressions and push the operation to the outside of the expression. The first term of the logical expression <code>x &amp; ~y</code> is true when <code>x</code> is negative and <code>y</code> is non-negative. The first factor of the next term <code>~(x ^ Y)</code> is true when both are negative or both are non-negative. The second factor <code>~((y &amp; vm) + ~(x &amp; vm) + 1))</code> is true when <code>y - x</code> is non-negative, in other words <code>x &lt;= y</code>, <em>ignoring the sign bit</em>. The two terms are ord, so using c++ logical expression syntax we have:</p>\n<pre><code>x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 0 || (x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0 || x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; y - x &gt;= 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>!!</code> outermost operators convert the raised sign bit to a <code>1</code>. Finally, here is the Modern C++ templated <code>constexpr</code> version:</p>\n<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;\nconstexpr T isLessOrEqual(T x, T y)\n{\n    using namespace std;\n    // compile time check that type T makes sense for this function\n    static_assert(is_integral&lt;T&gt;::value &amp;&amp; is_signed&lt;T&gt;::value, isLessOrEqual requires signed integral params);\n\n    T vm = numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::max();\n    T sm = ~vm;\n\n    return  !!

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33051386/dcast-warning-aggregation-function-missing-defaulting-to-length,r - dcast warning: ‘Aggregation function missing: defaulting to length’,"b'<p>The reason why you are getting this warning is in the description of <code>fun.aggregate</code> (see <code>?dcast</code>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>aggregation function needed if variables do not identify a single\n  observation for each output cell. Defaults to length (with a message)\n  if needed but not specified</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, an aggregation function is needed when there is more than one value for one spot in the wide dataframe.</p>\n<p><strong><em>An explanation based on your data:</em></strong></p>\n<p>When you use <code>dcast(df, Id + Task ~ Type, value.var=Freq)</code> you get:</p>\n<pre><code>  Id Task A B\n1  3    1 2 3\n2  3    2 3 0\n3  4    1 3 3\n4  4    2 1 3\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is logical because for each combination of <code>Id</code>, <code>Task</code> and <code>Type</code> there is only value in <code>Freq</code>. But when you use <code>dcast(df, Id ~ Type, value.var=Freq)</code> you get this (including a warning message):</p>\n<pre><code>Aggregation function missing: defaulting to length\n  Id A B\n1  3 2 2\n2  4 2 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, looking back at the top part of your data:</p>\n<pre><code>Id  Task Type    Freq  \n3     1    A       2\n3     1    B       3\n3     2    A       3\n3     2    B       0\n</code></pre>\n<p>You see why this is the case. For each combination of <code>Id</code> and <code>Type</code> there are two values in <code>Freq</code> (for Id 3: <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> for <code>A</code> &amp; <code>3</code> and <code>0</code> for Type <code>B</code>) while you can only put one value in this spot in the wide dataframe for each values of <code>type</code>. Therefore <code>dcast</code> wants to aggregate these values into one value. The default aggregation function is <code>length</code>, but you can use other aggregation functions like <code>sum</code>, <code>mean</code>, <code>sd</code> or a custom function by specifying them with <code>fun.aggregate</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, with <code>fun.aggregate = sum</code> you get:</p>\n<pre><code>  Id A B\n1  3 5 3\n2  4 4 6\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now there is no warning because <code>dcast</code> is being told what to do when there is more than one value: return the sum of the values.</p>'","b'<p><code>fun.aggregate</code> is required when different values <em>inside</em> <code>value.var</code> column corresponding to <em>identical</em> values - or combination of values - appearing on the LHS of <code>dcast</code> formula (e.g. Id), are forced into one cell by the combination of variables in the RHS of the formula (e.g. Type).</p>\n<p>Defaulting to <code>length()</code> in <code>dcast</code> is informative as it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>could suggest existence of coupling in the data, and</li>\n<li>locates <code>length &gt; 1</code> cases that may require attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More informative would be using function <code>list()</code> as <code>fun.aggregate</code> since it shows which <code>value.var</code> values are involved in each case:</p>\n<pre><code>dcast(dt, Id ~ Type, fun.aggregate = list, value.var = Freq)\n\n   Id   A   B\n1:  3 2,3 3,0\n2:  4 3,1 3,3\n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, table cells have length = 1. Therefore, the defaulting situation in <code>dcast</code> can be solved by modifying the formula or, by implementing a length-one summarization (aggregation): operators, custom or available functions that give a length-one result in each case and are fit for the purpose.</p>'",

Not with 100% accuracy, anyway. The pointer <em>has no length/size but its own</em>. All it does is point to a particular place in memory that holds a char. If that char is part of a string, then you can use <code>strlen</code> to determine what chars follow the one currently being pointed to, but that doesnt mean the <em>array</em> in your case is that big.<br/>\nBasically:</p>\n<p>A <strong><em>pointer</em></strong> is not an <strong><em>array</em></strong>, so it doesnt <em>need</em> to know what the size of the array is. A pointer can point to a single value, so a pointer can exist without there even being an array. It doesnt even care where the memory it points to is situated (Read only, heap or stack... doesnt matter). A pointer doesnt have a length other than itself. A pointer just is...<br/>\nConsider this:</p>\n<pre><code>char beep = \\a;\nvoid alert_user(const char *msg, char *signal); //for some reason\nalert_user(Hear my super-awsome noise!, &amp;beep); //passing pointer to single char!\n\nvoid alert_user(const char *msg, char *signal)\n{\n    printf(%s%c\\n, msg, *signal);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A pointer can be a single char, as well as the beginning, end or middle of an array...<br/>\nThink of chars as structs. You sometimes allocate a single struct on the heap. That, too, creates a pointer without an array.</p>\n<p>Using only a pointer, to determine how big an array it is pointing to is impossible. The closest you can get to it is using <code>calloc</code> and counting the number of consecutive \\0 chars you can find through the pointer. Of course, that doesnt work once youve assigned/reassigned stuff to that arrays keys and it also fails if the memory just <em>outside</em> of the array happens to hold <code>\\0</code>, too. So using this method is unreliable, dangerous and just generally silly. Dont. Do. It.</p>\n<p><em>Another analogy:</em><br/>\nThink of a pointer as a road sign, it points to <em>Town X</em>. The sign doesnt know what that town looks like, and it doesnt know or care (or can care) who lives there. Its job is to tell you where to find <em>Town X</em>. It can only tell you how far that town is, but not how big it is. That information is deemed irrelevant for road-signs. Thats something that you can only find out by looking at the town itself, not at the road-signs that are pointing you in its direction</p>\n<p>So, using a pointer the only thing you can do is:</p>\n<pre><code>char a_str[] = hello;//{h,e,l,l,o,\\0}\nchar *arr_ptr = &amp;a_str[0];\nprintf(Get length of string -&gt; %d\\n, strlen(arr_ptr));\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this, of course, only works if the array/string is \\0-terminated.</p>\n<p>As an aside:</p>\n<pre><code>int length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(char);//sizeof char is guaranteed 1, so sizeof(a) is enough\n</code></pre>\n<p>is actually assigning <code>size_t</code> (the return type of <code>sizeof</code>) to an <code>int</code>, best write:</p>\n<pre><code>size_t length = sizeof(a)/sizeof(*a);//best use ptrs type -&gt; good habit\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since <code>size_t</code> is an unsigned type, if <code>sizeof</code> returns bigger values, the value of <code>length</code> might be something you didnt expect...</p>'","b'<p>If the <code>char *</code> is 0-terminated, you can use <code>strlen</code></p>\n<p>Otherwise, there is no way to determine that information</p>'","b'<p>There are only two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the memory pointer to by your <code>char *</code> represents a C string (that is, it contains characters that have a 0-byte to mark its end), you can use <code>strlen(a)</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Otherwise, you need to store the length somewhere.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13006250/proper-way-to-pass-dynamic-arrays-to-other-functions,c++ - Proper way to pass dynamic arrays to other functions,"b'<p>Actually, the two first ideas pass the <strong>array by address</strong> and the third passes the array <strong>by reference</strong>. You can devise a little test to check this:</p>\n<pre><code>void test1(int* a) {\n    a[0] = 1;\n}\n\nvoid test2(int a[]) {\n    a[1] = 2;\n}\n\nvoid test3(int *&amp;a) {\n    a[2] = 3;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int *a = new int[3]();\n    a[0] = 0;\n    a[1] = 0;\n    a[2] = 0;\n\n    test1(a);\n    test2(a);\n    test3(a);\n\n    cout &lt;&lt; a[0] &lt;&lt; endl;\n    cout &lt;&lt; a[1] &lt;&lt; endl;\n    cout &lt;&lt; a[2] &lt;&lt; endl;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output of this test is</p>\n<pre><code>1\n2\n3\n</code></pre>\n<p>If a parameter is passed <strong>by value</strong>, it cannot be modified inside a function because the modifications will stay in the scope of the function. In C++, an array cannot be passed by value, so if you want to mimic this behaviour, you have to pass a <code>const int*</code> or a <code>const int[]</code> as parameters. That way, even if the array is passed by reference, it wont be modified inside the function because of the <code>const</code> property.</p>\n<p>To answer your question, the preferred way would be to use a <code>std::vector</code>, but if you absolutely want to use arrays, you should go for <code>int*</code>.</p>'","b'<p>Youre right. The first two are equivalent and pass a pointer by value. Stylistically the second is preferred as it describes the situation accurately, i.e. you are passing a pointer to your function. The first is a kind of hangover for people who cant quite believe that you cant pass arrays in C++. There is no way to pass an array by value in C++. The third passes a pointer by reference.</p>\n<p>Theres a confusion here in that in all cases the pointer refers to your array. So when talking about pass by value or pass by reference you should be clear whether you are speaking about the pointer or the array it refers to.</p>'","b'<pre><code>static void test(bool arr[])\nstatic void test(bool *arr, size_t size)\n</code></pre>\n<p>For static/dynamic arrays, if you dont want to change location of this pointer.</p>\n<p>Example:\n<a href=http://liveworkspace.org/code/c5e379ebe2a051c15261db05de0fc0a9 rel=nofollow>http://liveworkspace.org/code/c5e379ebe2a051c15261db05de0fc0a9</a></p>\n<pre><code>static void test(bool *&amp;arr)\n</code></pre>\n<p>For dynamic if you want to change location.</p>\n<p>Example: <a href=http://liveworkspace.org/code/bd03b214cdbe7c86c4c387da78770bcd rel=nofollow>http://liveworkspace.org/code/bd03b214cdbe7c86c4c387da78770bcd</a></p>\n<p>But, since you write on C++ - use vectors, instead of raw dynamic arrays.</p>'"
