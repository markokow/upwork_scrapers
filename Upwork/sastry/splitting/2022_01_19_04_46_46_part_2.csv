21380,Does osmosis release ATP?,"This process is related to osmosis, the diffusion of water across a membrane, which is why it is called chemiosmosis.

In both diffusion and osmosis, particles move from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration.</b>",Is ATP used in diffusion?,Simple diffusion does not require energy: <b>facilitated diffusion requires a source of ATP.

Simple diffusion and osmosis are both forms of passive transport and <b>require none of the cell's ATP energy</b>,Does osmosis take ATP?,"Osmosis refers to the diffusion of water or solvent through a selectively permeable membrane from the region of lower concentration of solute to the higher concentration until equilibrium is reached. As the movement is down the concentration gradient, it is a passive process and <b>does not require ATP.</b>",What does ATP have to do with osmosis?,The animation shows that movement occurs until the concentration of the molecules reaches equilibrium. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane.

21381,Can Baroreceptors override osmoreceptors?,Baroreceptors are <b>less sensitive (but more potent) than the osmoreceptors. The threshold of the volume receptors for causing changes in ADH secretion is an 8 to 10% change in blood volume. But when stimulated they cause ADH levels to be much higher than that seem with osmoreceptor stimulation.</b>,What do osmoreceptors do?,"Osmoreceptors (Fig. 4-11) located in the hypothalamus (and also in the carotid artery) are <b>capable of sensing the concentrations of solutes, particularly sodium ion. This leads to a secretion of vasopressin.</b>",What happens when osmoreceptors are activated?,"When plasma osmolality increases, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus <b>stimulate the release of ADH in blood, thus increasing water reabsorption and equilibrating plasma osmolality.</b>",How do osmoreceptors stimulate ADH?,"Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus regulate the amount of ADH released <b>in response to changes in the osmotic pressure of plasma.  This stimulates the osmoreceptors cells to contract, which results in afferent signals being sent from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary gland to increase the release of ADH.</b>",Are osmoreceptors and Baroreceptors the same?,There are two main types of receptors involved in the control of the body water balance-osmoreceptors and baroreceptors. Osmoreceptors reside in hypothalamus and respond to changes of extracellular fluid (ECF) osmolality. Baroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that sense blood pressure in the vessel wall.,How are osmoreceptors stimulated?,"When plasma osmolality increases, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus <b>stimulate the release of ADH in blood, thus increasing water reabsorption and equilibrating plasma osmolality.</b>",What are osmoreceptors sensitive to?,Special nerve cells called osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are very sensitive to <b>changes in serum osmolality.
