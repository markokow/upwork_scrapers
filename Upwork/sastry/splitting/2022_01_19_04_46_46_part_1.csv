21193,What happens in the Krebs cycle of aerobic respiration?,"The Krebs cycle is an eightstep cycle in which acetyl CoA is added to oxaloacetate, which is further broken down producing CO2, reduced coenzymes (NADH + H+ and FADH2), and ATP.  During this step coenzyme A is added, <b>carbon dioxide is lost, and NAD+ is reduced, forming NADH + H+.</b>",Where does the Krebs cycle aerobic or anaerobic?,"The citric acid cycle (Kreb's cycle) is <b>anaerobic, in that it doesn't require molecular oxygen itself. In eukaryotes, the citric acid cycle occurs in mitochondria, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain requires oxygen.</b>",How many turns of the Krebs cycle are completed in aerobic respiration?,Two turns,Is anaerobic respiration the same as the Krebs cycle?,The main difference between fermentation and anaerobic respiration is that fermentation <b>does not undergo citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and electron transport chain whereas anaerobic respiration undergoes citric acid cycle and electron transport chain.</b>,What happens during Krebs cycle?,"The Krebs cycle is the second stage of cellular respiration.
