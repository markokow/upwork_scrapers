One theme present in Ernest Hemingway's short story, The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber, is <b>that the way a person views his life can change completely in one fulfilling moment, if only for an instant.</b>",What are the symbols in The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?,"The savanna represents Wilson's world, the wild, savage force of nature. <b>The lion and the buffalo, representations of nature itself in all its brutal force, also come to symbolize the differences in courage and manhood that exist between Macomber and Wilson. Similarly, the guns themselves operate as symbols of manhood.</b>",Why is Macomber afraid during the lion hunt?,"He was afraid . . . [and] there was no one to tell he was afraid. Next morning, Margot recognizes that Macomber is upset, but he tells her simply that he's <b>nervous because of the lion's roaring throughout the night.  Thus Macomber's cowardice in this scene is the central motivating force for the entire story.</b>",Who killed the lion in The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?,"<b>Wilson shoots and kills the lion. After the men return to the car, Margot kisses Wilson. Macomber perceives that his wife has lost all respect for him. This signals new trouble in their marriage; they have known trouble previously, but their marriage has endured for eleven years despite their problems.</b>",What is the Somali proverb regarding hearing a lion roar?,"Macomber hears the roar of a lion and is unnerved because he has never heard, as Hemingway pointedly states, the Somali proverb that says, '<b>a brave man is always frightened three times by a lion: when he first sees his track, when he first hears him roar, when he first confronts him'.</b>",Did Margot sleep with Wilson?,"Though she has been married to Francis Macomber for eleven years, she flirts persistently and <b>eventually sleeps with Robert Wilson, and it is suggested that she has had affairs with other men as well.</b>",Why does Margot shoot Macomber?,"Margot picks up the gun to defend her husband, trying to save him in the face of danger. For once, husband and wife are both on the same side, shooting at the same bull. It is tragically ironic that she kills the man she is trying to save, but such is Hemingway's commentary on life.",What did Margot do that night after the first lion hunt?,"However, when Macomber is about to reclaim his manhood as he faces the water buffalo, she is so frightened of losing control over him that she fires (or perhaps pretends to fire) <b>at the charging water buffalo  and, instead, shoots her husband.</b>"

As per ",What does Pausanias say about Love?,"Pausanias argues that <b>loving is in itself neither a good nor a bad activity. If it is done properly, it is good, and if not, it is bad.

21828,What are three differences between shield and composite volcanoes?,"<b>Composite volcanoes have a low magma supply rate, resulting in infrequent eruptions. Shield volcanoes feature basaltic lava. This type of lava is hot, fluid and low in gas content.

Shield volcanoes are low with gently sloping sides and <b>are formed from layers of lava. Eruptions are typically non-explosive.</b>",What is the composition of a shield volcano?,"Shield volcanoes consist largely of <b>thin lava flows, with minor pyroclastic (mainly ash) layers. Their subaerial (above sea-level) slopes are mostly 4-8 degrees, having steep-walled summit calderas and also pit craters (sinkholes) that are similar to calderas in form but much smaller.</b>",What are the major differences between shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes?,"Stratovolcanoes <b>have relatively steep sides and are more cone-shaped than shield volcanoes. They are formed from viscous, sticky lava that does not flow easily. The lava therefore builds up around the vent forming a volcano with steep sides.</b>",What are the 3 types of volcanoes describe the differences between each type?,"There are three main types of volcano - <b>composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows.

Consequently, a volcanic mountain having a broad profile is built up over time by flow after flow of relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano.</b>",What are composite volcanoes most likely to form?,Composite volcanoes are some of the most dangerous volcanoes on the planet. They tend to occur along oceanic-to-oceanic or oceanic-to-continental boundaries because of subduction zones.
