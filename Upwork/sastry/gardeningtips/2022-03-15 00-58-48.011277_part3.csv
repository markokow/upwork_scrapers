Roses are the beautiful flowering <a data-ail=""5052"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-indoor-shrubs-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">shrubs</a> popularly grown in gardens. Are you planning to propagate <a data-ail=""5052"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/rose-classification-rose-species-rose-varieties"" target=""_self"">roses</a> in your garden? Then you can go through these following points to propagate rose plants through cuttings.</p>
<h3><span id=""A_step_by_step_guide_to_propagating_rose_plants_from_cuttings""><strong>A step by step guide to propagating rose plants from cuttings</strong></span></h3>
<p>You can grow the rose plants through cuttings which can be easily to grow roses in your garden but proper planting and care should be taken. The area where you grow roses should receive at least 6 hours of sunlight. Roses should be planted in an area where it is well-drained and fertile <a data-ail=""5052"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/preparing-soil-for-vegetable-garden-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">soil</a>.</p>
<h4><span id=""How_to_reproduce_and_regrow_roses_from_cuttings""><strong>How to reproduce and regrow roses from cuttings</strong></span></h4>
<p>Usually roses are simple to grow and you can easily propagate and regrow them from the same plant. Propagating is nothing but re-growing or reproduce in the simple way from cuttings instead from seeds which take a lot of time. Through cuttings you can produce many replicas from the parent plant. You no need to be trained person to propagate through cutting. It is just a simple process just to prepare cuttings like pieces of stem collected at different stages of maturity. But few rose plants are particular about the type of cutting will root and few are flexible in rooting.</p>
<h4><span id=""Different_types_of_rose_cuttings""><strong>Different types of rose cuttings</strong></span></h4>
<p>Rose cuttings can be taken from new stems at three main stages of growth. These include-</p>
<h5><span id=""Softwood_cuttings""><strong>Softwood cuttings</strong></span></h5>
<p>These give rise to fast growth of roots which should be collected  during late spring and early summer, where the stems at this time begins to mature. These care called softwood cuttings. These prime softwood cuttings are pencil sized which are located below rose blooms and dropped their petals.</p>
<h5><span id=""Semi-hardwood_cuttings""><strong>Semi-hardwood cuttings</strong></span></h5>
<p>These stem cuttings are collected during late summer and early fall, when new growing stems will partially mature. At this time these stems might have rosehips, before the blooming appears.</p>
<h5><span id=""Hardwood_cuttings""><strong>Hardwood cuttings </strong></span></h5>
<p>These cuttings will root slowly an sometimes difficult to root. These can be collected in late fall or early winter, where the stems have hardened matured and reaches their dormancy.</p>
<p>You can achieve the rooting in all these cuttings by treating the cuttings with root stimulating hormone which helps to stimulate the root development and in turn encourages the growth.</p>
<h4><span id=""How_to_collect_rose_cuttings_-things_required""><strong>How to collect rose cuttings –things required</strong></span></h4>
<p>Based on the type of cutting you chose you can collect the stem cutting from southern regions or northern growing zones. You can even collect them based on their fading blooms instead getting stuck to the timings mentioned.</p>
<p>Before you start collecting the stem cuttings, you need these things-</p>
<ul>
<li>A clean and sharp knife without any rust or you can also use the bypass pruners.</li>
<li>Make sure you are ready with lukewarm water which allows keeping the cuttings moist immediately after separating it from plant.</li>
<li>Rooting hormone is necessary if you want to make sure to your cuttings starts root growth.</li>
<li>A stick to make the holes in the mud to plant the collected rose cuttings.</li>

<p><strong>Step-1: </strong>Choose a stem near the withered loom and woody’s base and cut it at that area. This stem can make several cuttings. Make a note that choosing a strong, healthy stems above a set of leaves has capacity to rise into a separate plant quickly, that means it has great growing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Step-2:</strong>Clean the stem by removing the bloom and stem tip, later cut at 45 degree angle just above the first set of leaves at the bottom of the stem. Later place these stems in lukewarm water immediately to maintain the moisture level.</p>
<p><strong>Step-3:</strong>Cut each stem into 6 to 8 inch lengths, make sure that each cutting has four nodes that is the area where leaves emerge on stems. Ensure that you need to maintain the moisture in all the cuttings.</p>
<p><strong>Step-4: </strong>In this step you need to remove all theleaves for each cutting except at the top of each cutting. This helps in the more root production first and then starts with the shoot progress.</p>
<p><strong>Step-5:</strong>First moisten the cuttings and then dip the areas of the cuttings (which should be planted in the mud) in rooting hormone until covered, as this induces root growth quickly so that you can make your garden filled with rose plants reproduced from the parent plant.</p>
<p><strong>Step-6: </strong>Use a stick or pencil to make 3 to 4 inches of hole deep in the mud placed in a container or in the <a data-ail=""5052"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/raised-bed-vegetable-gardening-ideas-and-tips"" target=""_self"">raised bed</a> or the area in the garden. Make a sufficient bigger hole, so that you can insert the cutting without brushing off the hormone content stuck to the stem cutting.</p>
<p><strong>Step-7: </strong>Put thecutting into the hole, so that half of its bottom should be covered with mud especially at least two nodes should be covered and then make sure that the cutting is firmed with the soil. If you are planting multiple cuttings then you need to maintain at least 20 cm apart in between the cuttings placed.</p>
<p><strong>Step-8:</strong>The final step is the most important one to attain successful reproduction from rose cutting is that water them frequently and keep the area moist in the surrounding areas of cuttings planted. You can also create a mini green house for these rose cuttings by covering them with the plastic bag around the cutting after water them. This maintains the moisture content and forms a mini <a data-ail=""5052"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/greenhouse-gardening-ideas-basics-techniques-tips"" target=""_self"">greenhouse</a> for these rose cuttings.</p>
<p><strong>Step-9: </strong>Monitor the rose cuttings to ensure that they are hydrated regularly and whether they are developing roots. You can check these by observing the roots growing gently tugging into the soil. This can be tested by observing the slight resistance with 1-2 weeks after planting the rose cuttings in the soil. This means the cuttings has induced root growing well deep into the mud.</p>
<p><strong>Step-10: </strong>Slowly allow these cuttings to harden before transplanting them into the outside garden or separating them into the pots. So that you can provide good space for them to grow freely. These should be placed in cool and shady areas as the immediate hot sunlight might damage their growth.</p>

<h4><span id=""Different_methods_of_stem_propagation_by_cuttings""><strong>Different methods of stem propagation by cuttings</strong></span></h4>
<p>You can also propagate rose cuttings by using natural root growth stimulants like-</p>
<h5><span id=""Root_growth_by_using_honey""><strong>Root growth by using honey</strong></span></h5>
<p>Instead of growth hormone you can also use honey which is a natural stimulant of root growth, but make sure that this should not be planted directly into soil. If the cutting is dipped in honey then it should be placed in a bottle of water and it starts growing roots within a week. Later after observing the root formation then you can plant this into the mud. <strong> </strong></p>
<h5><span id=""Planting_the_cuttings_into_the_potato""><strong>Planting the cuttings into the potato </strong></span></h5>
<p>You can also plant the rose cutting in <a data-ail=""5052"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-potatoes-from-seed-planting-care-harvesting"" target=""_self"">potato</a>, but do not push the stem clear through the potato. Potato helps to maintain the good moisture content along with few carbohydrates. Plant the cutting along with the potato just 3 inches into the soil and tap it with mud and water it. Ethylene in potato helps in promoting root growth as it is a root stimulating hormone. You can also use damaged or rotten potato for planting rose cuttings, as they have more amount of ethylene in the rotten ones.</p>
<h5><span id=""The_best_time_to_plant_the_rose_cuttings""><strong>The best time to plant the rose cuttings</strong></span></h5>
<p>May to early June is the best time to plant the cuttings as this temperature and the little showers of rains can help in developing the quick rooting in the planted rose cuttings, i.e., within 2 to 3 weeks. In rest of the time it takes minimum of 6 to 8 weeks of time to develop rooting.</p>
<h4><span id=""Factors_necessary_to_develop_a_successful_rose_cuttings""><strong>Factors necessary to develop a successful rose cuttings</strong></span></h4>
<p>Most of the rose plants are easily propagated by cuttings, but these are the essential factors which should be taken into consideration to propagate the rose cutting successfully. These factors  include-</p>
<h5><span id=""Age_of_the_stem""><strong>Age of the stem</strong></span></h5>
<p>You can choose the stem to cut in a plant with once flowering one. Repeated flowering stems can also grow well when you chose it to propagate. But make sure that the stem should be young and the flower should be faded or you can choose the fallen petals one. Similar age wood part can also be selected as you can observe the subsequent growth flushes throughout the summer or fall.</p>
<h5><span id=""Leaves_on_the_ruttings_of_the_stem""><strong>Leaves on the ruttings of the stem</strong></span></h5>
<p>Roses root best if the cuttings have few leaves as they help in converting the light into energy source to the other parts of the plant especially in transportation of sugars. At least maintain 2 to 3 leaves in stem cuttings. But make sure that you water them regularly.</p>
<h5><span id=""Wounding_at_the_base_of_the_stem""><strong>Wounding at the base of the stem</strong></span></h5>
<p>Most of them make wounds to ensure the root growth from all the sides this is not necessary for all the varieties. Wounding is done by slicing the ends of the cuttings with sharp blades slanting way.</p>

<h5><span id=""Usage_of_rooting_hormones""><strong>Usage of rooting hormones</strong></span></h5>
<p>It is not compulsory to dip the cuttings in rooting hormone. As the cuttings of rose plants have auxins such as IAA which induces root growth naturally. But if you want to see the quick root growth you can use rooting hormone as few roses and cutting show some difficulty in rooting, hence it is better to use the rooting hormone in propagation of rose cuttings.</p>

<p>Roses root and grow best in bright light. But care should be taken that it should be provided with over heat which damages the tissue of the rose cutting. Hence you need to provide some <a data-ail=""5052"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/shade-vegetable-gardening-ideas-tips-techniques"" target=""_self"">shade</a> in the hot and mid-day sun. Cuttings should be placed under the shade of a building or the shade of a tree so that to allow rooting in a proper way avoiding the too much heat during day time.</p>

Foliage plants are considered to have decorative, colorful and interesting leaves. Such plants can make interesting garden spaces and can provide <a data-ail=""4734"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/shade-vegetable-gardening-ideas-tips-techniques"" target=""_self"">shade</a>, color, and cover for a range of needs.</p>
<h3><span id=""A_step_by_step_guide_to_growing_indoor_foliage_plants""><strong>A step by step guide to growing indoor foliage plants</strong></span></h3>
<p>Foliage plant is used to describe a collection of leaves. As an effect, the term foliage plant is usually used to describe green plants with ornament-like leaves. Given that our modern-day lives leave us craving for clean air quality, <u>foliage plants</u> are a great addition to develop the air quality of our homes, making foliage plants popular among indoor plant options. Using foliage for decoration and cover has the advantage of being a long-lasting effect that can outlast shorter-term flowers and annuals. This can have such advantages as ongoing decorative appeal, longer-term shading or cover and even food sources where relevant.</p>
<p>Foliage plants add a bit of greenery to indoor space and can even help clean the air. Plants that generally live in the rainforest, a tropical setting or even a desert can get acclimated to the conditions in your home. Choosing the right plant to grow based on the conditions in your home and learning how to care for that plant is key to your success as a grower of houseplants.</p>

<p>Foliage plants are beautiful, colorful, interesting, and easy to grow. <u>Foliage plants for containers</u> add color, form, and texture to <u>container garden designs</u>. Many are easy to produce and maintain, and most overwinter well. <u>Ornamental grasses</u> are also foliage plants and many grow well in container gardens.</p>
<h4><span id=""Basic_requirements_of_foliage_plants""><strong>Basic requirements of foliage plants</strong></span></h4>
<p>Foliage plants have a few basic requirements for proper growth and development. The sunlight obtainable needs to be optimal for photosynthesis. The foliage plant environment needs to have the necessary humidity for the plant you are trying to grow. Since the leaves of foliage plants are sensitive to temperature, it is very important to ensure the leaves are not exposed to extreme heat or cold temperatures and are able to grow in ideal controlled temperatures. Last but not least, the <u>watering of the Foliage plant</u> is very important for its growth and function.</p>

<p>These Foliage plants can act as natural filters against bad air quality and help build a healthier home environment. This is why Foliage plants opted as indoor Foliage plants. While choosing a foliage plant it is very important to understand the nature of the plant and the way the leaves will react to seasonal changes.</p>

<h4><span id=""Choosing_foliage_plants_for_your_home""><strong>Choosing foliage plants for your home </strong></span></h4>
<p>In choosing your Foliage plants, consider the location’s environment. Find out whether a particular plant will only survive or thrive in that environment. It is very important, to begin with, good quality, healthy, pest-free plants. Make sure plant leaves possess good color for the species, with no brown tips or margins.</p>
<h4><span id=""Lighting_for_growing_indoor_foliage_plants""><strong>Lighting for growing indoor foliage plants</strong></span></h4>
<p>Light can be a big issue for the health and survival of Foliage plants. Some Foliage plants will survive in and prefer to live in low light conditions. Others require brightly lit interiors to survive.</p>
<p>A south-facing window is generally the ideal <u>location for Foliage plants</u> that need bright light. North-facing or east-facings are better for plants that choose darker conditions. Keep in mind that there are few plants that will survive in completely dark or very dimly lit rooms. If a room has very small windows or windows that just don’t let in a lot of suns, putting a grow light in those rooms might be necessary.</p>
<h4><span id=""The_best_temperature_for_growing_indoor_foliage_Plants""><strong>The best temperature for </strong><strong>growing indoor foliage Plants</strong></span></h4>
<p>The best <u>temperature range for most indoor foliage plants</u> is between 60 and 80°F. (16-27°C.) These temperature ranges are similar to those found in the understory of a tropical forest. Chilling injury occurs below 50°F for most tropical plants.</p>

<p>Temperatures in the indoor and office can be quite variable, changing daily or seasonally. Remember that southern and western exposures are warm because of the amount of sunlight, while eastern and northern are moderate or cool. Avoid locating Foliage plants on cold window sills, or where there are cold or hot drafts from opening doors and heating or air conditioning vents. Leaf spots, blotches, downward curled foliage, and slowed growth are signs of bad temperatures. Temperatures that are too high can cause yellowish-green foliage, which can have brown, dry edges or tips and spindly growth. Insect, mite and disease problems can develop quickly under warm conditions as well.</p>

<p>Make sure to have the proper <a data-ail=""4734"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/preparing-soil-for-vegetable-garden-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">soil</a> mix for each Foliage plant as well and a good mix won’t break down or degrade over time. Be sure to use a mixture of particle sizes so there are excellent drainage and aeration for the plant’s roots. Most plants do well in a soil mix containing one to two parts <a data-ail=""4734"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/potting-soil-mix-for-vegetables-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">potting soil</a>, one to two parts moistened <a data-ail=""4734"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/peat-moss-for-vegetable-garden-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">peat moss</a> and one part coarse sand. Native soil from the indoor garden can be used in a mix if it’s pasteurized.</p>
<p>Foliage plants can be grown in a <u>variety of soil mixes</u>, but are easier to care for if planted in soils containing high levels of peat moss. Such soils retain water and fertilizer and provide excellent aeration if peat moss is mixed with coarse sandy soils or <a data-ail=""4734"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/hydroponics-perlite-growing-medium-advantages"" target=""_self"">perlite</a>. The following soil combinations are suggested for growing foliage plants, or prepackaged soils can be obtained with similar properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 parts peat, 1 part perlite, 1 part coarse sand.</li>
<li>1 part peat. 1 part vermiculite, 1 part coarse sand.</li>
<li>2 parts peat, 1 part coarse sand.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""watering_for_growing_indoor_foliage_Plants""><strong>watering for </strong><strong>growing indoor foliage Plants</strong></span></h4>
<p>Indoor Foliage plants are adapted to regions where the soil is moist, but not continually saturated with water. So, never allow soils to become completely dry between watering, and when to waterlog, apply enough water to thoroughly wet the entire soil ball. One of the best methods to do this in large plantings is with automatic watering systems. Watering frequency mainly depends on weather, type, and size of plant and stage of plant growth.</p>
<p>Containers with drainage holes must be placed in a saucer or other containers and sufficient water applied at each waterlog until excess water drains out the bottom. This water should then be discarded since pots must not be allowed to stand in water for any length of time. Containers without drainage must have a layer of coarse gravel placed in the bottom to allow space for excess water. A good method to check these containers for excess water is to lay them on their side in a sink or to use a dip-stick inside a hollow pipe. Poor watering probably harm or kill Foliage plants more than any other care issue. A regular problem is over-watering plants and too much water causes the roots to rot.</p>
<h4><span id=""Application_of_fertilizers_for_growing_indoor_foliage_Plants""><strong>Application of fertilizers for growing indoor foliage Plants</strong></span></h4>
<p>When foliage plants are used for interior design purposes, little fertilization is required, and then it is desirable to keep plants from growing excessively. Application of <a data-ail=""4734"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-fertilizers-for-vegetables-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">fertilizers</a> more than once a month is unnecessary and in most cases four applications a year will be sufficient unless considerable new growth is desired. Many types of fertilizers are obtainable for specialized indoor use and are frequently more convenient than types sold for yards or gardens. Follow directions given on pots or containers when using pre-packaged products sold specifically for “foliage plants”.</p>
<h4><span id=""Some_of_the_indoor_foliage_plants""><strong>Some of the indoor foliage plants</strong></span></h4>
<p>Here we discuss <u>some of the indoor Foliage plants</u> are given below;</p>
<h5><span id=""Aluminum_plant""><strong>Aluminum plant </strong></span></h5>
<p>The aluminum plant is a bush type plant that grows up to 12 inches tall and displays glossy green and silver oval-shaped leaves. Place the Aluminum plant in a brightly lit spot with some sunlight to encourage it to thrive and grow well. Pruning each spring encourages new growth and spread.</p>
<p>Enjoy the fun, metallic-silver splotches of aluminum plant green leaves. It makes a <u>tabletop plant</u> or hanging basket. If the aluminum plant gets leggy, move it to brighter light and pinch it back to force more compact growth.</p>
<h5><span id=""Cast_Iron_Plant""><strong>Cast Iron Plant </strong></span></h5>
<p>Cast iron prefers rich, fertile soil, but it will tolerate a range of soil conditions. If you want to use cast iron plant as a groundcover, space the plants 12 to 18 inches apart to leave the room to grow and water them initially to help them get established. After that, they will be quite drought-tolerant, though they will perform better if watered periodically.</p>
<h5><span id=""Croton_plants""><strong>Croton plants</strong></span></h5>
<p>This croton species enjoy its bright light, high humidity levels and moist soil which drains well. The plant leaves on the most popular variety are leathery types which are green with yellow prominent veins that turn a reddish-purple color. Because these plants require bright light and space they’re grown quite often in conservatories or greenhouses.</p>
<p>Many croton plants grow best in full sun, but many cultivars can tolerate, and even prefer light shade partial shade. As houseplants, croton plants add texture and color to dull interiors. When used indoors select a cultivar such as the Petra croton, which can remain brightly colored in indoor light conditions. Even these cultivars will eventually lose partial color if adequate light is not obtainable.</p>
<h5><span id=""Dumb_Cane""><strong>Dumb Cane </strong></span></h5>
<p>The dumb cane plant is an easy to grow plant that survives well on basic care conditions that should be provided. Due to its easy-going nature, it’s become a popular <u>ornamental foliage house plant</u>. Once the plant matures it can reach up to 6ft in height, although 3 to 4ft is more common. Like many other <u>foliage house plants</u> they do make flowers in their natural habitat, but rarely indoors.</p>
<h5><span id=""Golden_Pothos""><strong>Golden Pothos </strong></span></h5>
<p>The golden pothos is a climbing type vine that has aerial roots. Because these grow up to 6 feet tall and only have thin stems they need support if a grower wants it to grow upwards in height rather than hanging. Common technique growers use to support the golden pothos is using a moss stick.</p>

<p>Hello gardeners, today, we discuss the topic of “Garden Aphids Control Methods”. What are Aphids? Aphids are the tiny soft body insects that feed on plant leaves mostly. They are pear-shaped green or brown or black in color. The Aphid insects suck the cell sap of the plant leaves. They move slowly on plant leaves. Adult aphids are wingless. Aphids are called with various names like green flies, a plant louse, etc. Aphids size about pinhead. On the abdomen region, there is a pin-like project known as cornicles. They are the most common insect pests in the urban gardens, home gardens, and poly houses and greenhouses. There are about 1500 to 1600 species out of which 80 to 90 species of aphids cause damages to plants. Aphids live mostly in <a data-ail=""455"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/shade-vegetable-gardening-ideas-tips-techniques"" target=""_self"">shade</a> areas. As many of the urban gardeners are facing the problem of aphids infestation in their home gardens. We have come up with this article on How to Control Aphids at home gardens or urban gardens. In this post, we will let you know how to differentiate aphids from another aphid-like insect, the life cycle of aphids, how to find out the symptoms caused by aphid damage, organic control or management of aphids and chemical management of aphids.</p>

<h4><span id=""How_to_find_Aphids_on_Urban_garden_plants""><strong>How to find Aphids on Urban garden plants</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>As they are tiny and green it is easy to find them. The color may vary from light yellow to green.</li>
<li>Presence of cornicles on their body.</li>
<li>We can find easily by observing the colonies.</li>
<li>Some of the aphids are commensalism with the ants.</li>
<li>Aphids have 2 pairs of wings and three pairs of legs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""The_life_cycle_of_aphids""><strong>The life cycle of aphids</strong></span></h4>
<p>Aphids are the insect pests that have a complicated life cycle. The wingless mother known as stem mothers reproduces without fertilization known as parthenogenesis. These stem mother cells give birth to young ones which further fly on to the new host plants feeds on them. In the late summer or early winter, these insects give birth to male and female aphids. Aphids have egg nymph and adult stages. Eggs of aphids are elliptical or oval in shape with pale yellow to light green color that may further turn to black color. The Nymphs are wingless green to yellow in color. They secrete some wax gland secretions from their body during adverse environmental conditions known as woolly aphids. These secretions attract the <a data-ail=""455"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/getting-rid-of-ants-in-vegetable-garden-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">ants</a> and the ants feed on this gell secretions and protect the aphids from various insect predators.</p>

<h4><span id=""Symptoms_produced_by_Aphids_infection""><strong>Symptoms produced by Aphids infection</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>The symptoms of aphids infestation can be easily seen in the plants.</li>
<li>Colonies in clusters are seen on the infested plant stems, leaves and buds.</li>
<li>On young shoots, distortion and wilting are seen.</li>
<li>The premature death of the seedlings.</li>
<li>Yellowing of the leaves.</li>
<li>Honeydew secretions on the heavily infested plants leave or stems.</li>
<li>There are also some symptoms like mosaics, chlorosis, gall formation, stunting that are indirectly caused by aphids as they act as a vector for many plant disease-causing viruses.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""Economic_damage_to_garden_plants""><strong>Economic damage to garden plants</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Most of the Aphids cause damage to garden plants by sucking their leaves cell sap which directly affects the photosynthesis and leads to death or economic damage to the infested plants.</li>
<li>In addition, some aphids act as a virus vector where the transfers plant disease viruses like alfalfa mosaic virus, Cucumber mosaic virus or CMV, PVY or Potato Virus Y which causes heavy and severe damage to the plants.</li>
<li>Aphids almost transmit 40 to 50 plant viruses.</li>
<li>There are also some quarantine viruses where aphids transmit.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""Management_of_Aphids_in_Home_Gardens""><strong>Management of Aphids in Home Gardens</strong></span></h4>
<p>Although it is difficult to control or kill Aphids, proper integrated pest management (IPM) practices may ultimately lead to effective control and management of Aphids in Home gardens as well as in Poly houses and greenhouses. It includes <u>Biological control using various insect predators and organic control of aphids and chemical management of aphids.</u></p>
<h4><span id=""Monitoring_of_Aphids_in_Urban_Garden""><strong>Monitoring of Aphids in Urban Garden</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring plays an important role in urban gardens. Rapid checking for Aphids at an early stage may have higher chances to compete for control of Aphids in the urban gardens.</li>
<li>The early you check, the early you can eradicate the Aphid insect pests at less cost and investment.</li>

<h4><span id=""Organic_control_of_Aphids_or_Natural_control_of_Aphids""><strong>Organic control of Aphids or Natural control of Aphids</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>It includes spraying of various natural leaf extracts or plant-based extracts.</li>
<li>It is also known as a natural control of Aphids.</li>
<li>Spray <u>Aphid repellent sprays</u> like Garlic spray and neem leaf oil spray or neem oil @ 2 to 5 % based on the incidence that controls the Aphids to an extent at home gardens.</li>
<li>Use yellow sticky traps for every 100 plants that control Aphids naturally.</li>
<li>Grow trap crops around the greenhouses.</li>
<li>Natural enemies lacewings also act as a predator on Aphid insects.</li>
<li>Release or mass produce various Aphids predators or parasitoids like ladybird beetles and <em>Aphidiuscolemani</em> that control the Aphid insect pests naturally.</li>
<li>There are also some parasitic wasps that lay eggs on aphids that ultimately kills the Aphids.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""Nonchemical_methods_to_control_Aphids""><strong>Nonchemical methods to control Aphids</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>It includes the use of aphid or virus-free seedlings in the urban garden.</li>
<li>Use screens at greenhouses or urban gardens to control Aphids.</li>
<li>Use Aphids transmitted virus free cultivars.</li>
<li>Grow trap crops like plants that attract various natural enemy insect predators that feed on the aphids.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""Chemical_to_control_Aphids_in_Urban_gardens""><strong>Chemical to control Aphids in Urban gardens</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>There are many and various chemicals that are available in the market that effectively controls the Aphid pests at urban gardens. However, never go for heavy doe spray of these chemical insecticides in the urban garden. Even if you use, spray at fewer concentrations of insecticides and use nose mask, gloves while spraying f chemical insecticides at urban gardens.</li>
<li>Seed treatment of the urban garden seeds with synthetic chemical insecticides like imidachloprid @ 10 ml per kg seed or thiamethoxan @5gm per kg seed.</li>
<li>However, you can also spray NSKE or Neem Seed Kernel Extract @ 5% whenever you see Aphid incidence in your urban garden. Spray imidachloprid or chloranthriniliprol @ 0.5 to 2% on infested urban garden plants.</li>
<li>In addition, you can also go for stem smearing of the Aphid infested Urban garden plants with Imidachloprid 17.8 SL 1 ml + 20 ml plain water.</li>
</ul>
