Your <u>vegetable garden soil</u> supports vegetable plants by providing warmth, air, moisture, and nutrients. Healthy soil is the basis of healthy plants and an environment. When garden soil is in good shape there is less require for <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-fertilizers-for-vegetables-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">fertilizers</a> or pesticides.</p>
<p>If you want to grow your vegetables, the garden needs to have the proper type of soil to provide nutrients to your plants. Luckily, there are easy ways that you can prepare the soil to obtain the best yield throughout the growing season. Start by testing the soil in your garden, then use organic materials and fertilizers to adjust the pH range and drainage.</p>
<p>Garden soil properties for vegetables include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil particles, which are mineral materials broken down into some particles smaller than pebbles.</li>
<li>Organic matter and humus, this includes formerly living creatures mostly plants in various stages of decomposition.</li>
<li>Only half of the soil is solid particles, the rest is a mixture of air and water.</li>
<li>Air space in the soil allows oxygen and carbon dioxide to move in and out of the soil, which allows vegetable plant roots to grow. Encouraging worms is a great way to maintain your soil healthy as they will aerate the soil.</li>
<li>Water is necessary for vegetable plants to grow. If your garden soil is too wet is can be harmful to the soil and plant growth. Water saturated soil prevents the oxygen from getting to the plant roots. When the soil has the right quantity of moisture, the water will encase the soil particles and dissolve them. This procedure allows nutrients to be absorbed by the plant roots through the water.</li>
<li>Healthy soil has a balance of soil particles, organic humus, water, and excellent air circulation. All this allows the plant roots to absorb the nutrients required to grow well and produce healthy fruit, pods, and leaves.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are we waiting for? let us jump into preparing soil for vegetable garden.</p>
<h4><span id=""Types_of_soil""><strong>Types of soil</strong></span></h4>
<p>There are three main <u>types of soil for a vegetable garden</u>;</p>
<p>Soil type can determine which vegetables produce best for you. Knowing your garden soil type enables you to overcome problems since you can prepare the ground accordingly. Both the texture and pH level of the soil is worth knowing and these can vary throughout your garden or plot.</p>
<p>The best soil for most vegetable plants to ensure optimum growth is a rich, sandy loam. This garden soil is an even mixture of all three main types of soil are sand, silt, and clay.</p>
<p>These garden soil types refer to the size of the majority of the mineral elements making up the soil. Sand is the largest and clay, microscopic, and is the smallest.</p>

<p>Loamy soils have a good body and normally good moisture retention and drainage capacity. Both are extremely very important. The main <u>cause of plant failure in a vegetable garden</u> is bad water management. Either the plant dries out, causing the tiny hair-like root extensions to die, or these hair-like feeder roots are drowned by soil which fails to drain accurately. In either case, this causes the main stress to the plant. A garden soil that allows a plant to remain moist rather than dry or wet produces optimal growth.</p>
<p>Soil is the foundation of a healthy garden, and the healthy microorganisms in the soil aid the plants in obtaining their nutrients, healthy soil is necessary to a vegetable gardener. It is a pretty good rule of thumb that no matter which of the soil types you have when you <u>start a vegetable garden</u>, there is lots of room for improvement, and improvement is not difficult to accomplish. It is also true that the longer you garden in one place and take <u>care of the garden soil</u>, the healthier the soil, and thus the garden will become. Vegetable gardens do best in loose loamy soil with lots of organic matter and a slightly acidic pH level.</p>
<p><strong>Different Plants for Different Soils</strong></p>
<p>Soil is normally described by the amount of sand, clay, and silt it contains. This is called texture. Soil texture is mainly related to nutrient quality and drainage capabilities.</p>
<h5><span id=""Loam_Soil""><strong>Loam Soil</strong></span></h5>
<p>A loam soil mainly contains a nice balance of silt, sand, and clay along with hummus. Loamy soil, a moderately even mix of sand, silt, and clay, feels fine-textured and slightly damp. It has ideal characteristics for <u><a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/starting-a-vegetable-garden-from-scratch-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">vegetable gardening</a></u>, lawns, and <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-indoor-shrubs-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">shrubs</a>. Loamy soil has great structure, sufficient drainage, full of nutrients, simply cultivated and it warms up quickly in spring however doesn’t dry out quickly in summer. Loamy soils need replenishing with organic matter regularly and tend to be acidic.</p>
<h5><span id=""Sandy_Soil""><strong>Sandy Soil</strong></span></h5>
<p>Sandy soil is the largest particle in soil and does not hold nutrients well. Sandy soils contain large particles and gaps between them. This allows water and nutrients to drain away freely and making sandy soils less fertile than heavier soils. Sandy soils tend to dry out in the summer but they warm up quickly in spring (allowing seedlings a good start) and they are easier to dig than clay-based soils. If your soil is sandy, you must have no trouble <u>growing root vegetables</u> such as <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/planting-carrots-in-pots-a-complete-guide"" target=""_self"">carrots</a> and parsnips, but you may struggle with nutrient-hungry brassicas such as cabbages and <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/broccoli-gardening-techniques-ideas-and-tips"" target=""_self"">broccoli</a>. Vegetable plants with shallow roots are prone to drying out as sandy soils lose moisture faster than heavier soils.</p>
<h5><span id=""Clay_Soil""><strong>Clay Soil</strong></span></h5>
<p>Soils with a large quantity of clay are heavy and do not drain well. Clay soil is poor at draining and has few air spaces and if the drainage for the soil is enhanced, then plants will develop and grow well as clay soil can be rich in nutrients.</p>
<h5><span id=""Silt_Soil""><strong>Silt Soil</strong></span></h5>
<p>Silty soil is powdery with very high fertility. Unfortunately, soils that are high in silt can become waterlogged easily. Silty soil feels soft and soapy, it holds moisture, is usually rich in nutrients. This soil is easily cultivated and can be compacted with little effort. This is a great soil for your vegetable garden if drainage is provided and managed. Mixing in composted organic matter is usually required to improve drainage and structure while adding nutrients.</p>

<h4><span id=""Simple_tests_to_determine_your_soil_type""><strong>Simple tests to determine your soil type</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>The water test – </strong>Pour water onto your garden soil. If it drains quickly it is likely to be a sandy or gravelly soil, on clay soils the water will get longer to sink in.</p>
<p><strong>Squeeze test – </strong>Grab a handful of soil and softly compress it in your fist and <strong>i</strong>f the soil is sticky and slick to the touch and remains intact and in the same shape when you let go it will be clay soil. If the soil is spongy it’s peaty soil; sandy soil will feel gritty and crumble apart. Loamy soils and silty soils will feel smooth textured and hold their shape for a short period.</p>
<p><strong>Settle test</strong> – Add a handful of soil to a transparent container, add water, shake well and then leave to settle for about 12 hours. Clay and silty soils will leave cloudy water with a layer of particles at the bottom. Sandy soils will leave the water generally clear and most of the particles will fall, forming a layer on the base of the container. Peaty soils will see several particles floating on the surface; the water will be slightly cloudy with a thin layer at the bottom. Chalky soils will leave a layer of whitish, grit-like fragments on the bottom of the pot or container and the water will be a <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/shade-vegetable-gardening-ideas-tips-techniques"" target=""_self"">shade</a> of pale grey. If the water is quite clear with layered particles on the bottom of the pot with the finest particle at the top this soil is likely to be a loamy one.</p>
<p><strong>Acid test</strong> – The standard pH level for soils usually ranges between 4.0 and 8.5. Plants favor soil which has a pH level between 6.5 and 7 because this is the level where nutrients and minerals naturally thrive. You can buy a pH test kit, or from a local garden center. As a general rule, in places with soft water, you will have acid soil and hard water areas will tend to have alkaline soil.</p>
<p><strong>Soil test kit</strong> – Use a soil test kit to assess primary nutrients (N-P-K) with pH levels. By testing garden soil, you determine its exact condition so you can fertilize more effectively. The soil must be tested periodically throughout the growing season.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4><span id=""Importance_of_a_soil_test_for_preparing_soil_for_vegetable_garden""><strong>Importance of a soil test for </strong><strong>preparing soil for vegetable garden</strong></span></h4>
<p>Growing vegetables need nutrients to develop properly. While many of these nutrients come from fertilizer or compost that you add after planting, the roots absorb nutrients, and as well as water and oxygen.</p>
<p>Root absorption is the key to feeding and watering the vegetable garden. Soil conditions should be appropriate for a good root system to develop. A soil test lets you know which vitamins and nutrients are present in the existing soil. This includes the main nutrients and micro-nutrients, all of which are important to the growth of your crops.</p>
<p>Planting a vegetable garden without first testing the soil is like driving a vehicle while wearing a blindfold. The results of your test advise which amendments you should add to get the soil ready for the optimum growth of your crops.</p>
<p>Your soil test could indicate the necessity of growing your garden in a different location. Should your sample find contamination with heavy metals, you should not produce food in the area.</p>

<p>Crop quality greatly depends on garden soil composition. The ideal soil is balanced, well-drained, and fertile and with a pH level (acidity level) situated between 6 and 7. Adding <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-lemon-tree-in-pots-indoors-balcony-terrace"" target=""_self"">lime</a> corrects the pH level for soil that is too acidic (soil analysis required). Sandy soil is too barren in organic matter, and clay soil is heavy and compact. It is very important to add decomposed <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-manures-for-vegetables-components-of-manure"" target=""_self"">manure</a> or compost, as well as improving soil structure and composition will supply nutritive elements required by the vegetable plants.</p>

<h4><span id=""Preparing_soil_for_a_vegetable_garden""><strong>Preparing soil for a vegetable garden</strong></span></h4>
<p>Before you plant any vegetables, prepare garden beds by digging the soil and adding organic compost at least 1-2 weeks before you start planting. Most vegetables need 15-20 centimeters of good soil for their roots to grow. If you’re planning to produce crops with deeper roots, like potatoes or carrots, dig and compost deeper – up to 30 centimeters. Water in the compost and let it break down before you <u>plant vegetables</u>. To get the most out of your <u>vegetable garden</u>, select vegetables that you will use and plant them at the right time of year.</p>
<p>Turn the garden soil over in the fall (about 20 cm deep), to even and lighten it and get rid of the rocks, roots, and weeds. And cover with a thin coat of well-decomposed manure or compost.</p>
<p>Hoe the top 3 or 4 centimeters of garden soil early in the spring to lighten the surface layer and to blend it with organic matter spread the previous fall. Remove harmful weeds also. It is recommended not to work the soil when it is wet while the resulting compacting will harm soil quality. Adding biological-type fertilizers based on seaweed, bone meal or other organic products is recommended to create good crops.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4><span id=""Best_soil_for_vegetables""><strong>Best soil for vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<p>The <u>best soil for a vegetable garden</u> mainly depends on the type of garden you have. For a <a data-ail=""4593"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/raised-bed-vegetable-gardening-ideas-and-tips"" target=""_self"">raised bed</a> garden you will want a 50/50 ratio of compost and topsoil. For a field garden, you require soil that drains well. Clay soil will require to be amended to ensure the water drains properly. You can amend using also gypsum, vermiculite or expanded shale.</p>
<p>The essential nutrient levels are relative to the soil type and the crop being grown. While <u>different vegetable plants</u> have varying requirements, the soil test institution calculates an optimum average for fertilizer and lime recommendations.</p>
<p>The results of the soil test will indicate the pH level (acid-alkaline balance) of the soil as well as the nitrogen content, phosphorus content, and potassium content. The pH level is measured on a scale of 1 (most acid or sour) to 14 (most alkaline or sweet), with 7 representing neutral. Most vegetable plants generate best in a soil that has a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. The pH number is very important because it affects the availability of most of the essential nutrients in the soil. The soil lab will consider the type of soil you have, the pH, and the crops you intend to produce and make a recommendation for pH adjustment.</p>
<p>Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels will be mainly indicated by a “Low,” “Medium,” or “High” level. High is the preferred level for vegetable gardens for both nutrients. If your test results show other than High, a recommendation of type and quantity of fertilizer will be made.</p>
<p>Although nitrogen (N) is needed in large amounts by plants, the soil nitrates level is not usually routinely tested because rainfall leaches nitrates from the soil, which easily results in low levels. Additional nitrogen through the use of a complete fertilizer is always recommended.</p>
<h4><span id=""Soil_pH_importance_for_preparing_soil_for_vegetable_garden""><strong>Soil pH importance for </strong><strong>preparing soil for vegetable garden</strong></span></h4>
<p>Soil pH level is a measure of the soil’s acidity or alkalinity. Knowing the pH of soil helps to determine which vegetables to plant.</p>
<p>Alkaline soil has a pH level of around 8.5 whilst the pH of neutral soil is 7. Most plants produce best in soil with a pH of between 6.5 and 6.8. You can identify the soil’s pH level using a testing kit. These can vary from a cheap soil pH meter, which is simply pushed into the ground and examined, to kits that include color charts and tubes. The latter gives more reliable results. For the best results, take small samples of soil from various areas of your garden or vegetable plot.</p>
<h4><span id=""Improving_your_soil_fertility""><strong>Improving your soil fertility</strong></span></h4>
<p>Whatever your soil type, organic matter such as homemade compost and leaf mold must be added regularly to improve structure and nutrient content. Organic matter mainly helps to break up heavy clay soils, improving drainage, and binds together sandy soil, improving retention of water and nutrients. If added once a year, organic matter will improve soil and overcome any problems associated with the texture. Adding organic matter can also slightly lower the pH level of the soil to a level perfect for most vegetables. That’s all folks hope you have enjoyed preparing soil for vegetable garden and keep gardening!.</p>

Deep soil, enriched with organic matter encourages the growth of healthy plants as the extensive roots are able to reach out for more nutrients and water. As a result, you get extra-lush, extra-productive growth above the ground. The greatest way to achieve that deep layer of fertile soil is to build raised beds.</p>
<h3><span id=""A_step_by_step_guide_to_raised_bed_vegetable_gardening""><strong>A step by step guide to raised bed vegetable gardening</strong></span></h3>
<p>It is believed raised beds yield up to four times more than the equal amount of space planted in rows. That is not only due to their loose, fertile soil but also because of well-organized spacing. By making use of less space for paths, you have more room to grow plants.

<li><strong>Pick the appropriate spot</strong></li>
<li><strong> Determine bed size and layout</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Don’t construct beds wider than 4 feet, this way you can effortlessly reach to the center.</li>
<li>The perfect depth is between 12 and 24 inches.</li>
<li>Leave at least an 18-inch path between beds to perform activities like plantation, irrigation, and harvesting</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""Types_of_raised_beds_to_grow_vegetables""><strong> Types of raised beds to grow vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<h5><span id=""Raised_ground_beds""><strong> Raised ground beds</strong></span></h5>
<p>The easiest type of raised beds is flat-topped mounds, which are generally six to eight inches in height. They need no materials other than additional soil this is a traditional method often preferred for horticultural crops.</p>
<p>Additional soil is required to form the beds or dig up three to four inches of soil from pathways between beds. If you bring in additional soil, be sure it is free of soil-borne plant pathogens or contaminants such as pesticides.</p>
<p>Decide the appropriate size of the raised ground bed the maximum width should be 2½ feet depending on how far you can reach. If you have access from both sides, the bed can be made up to five feet wide. Though length and shape are completely up to you. To prepare the bed itself, add four to six inches of finished compost, <a data-ail=""6010"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/peat-moss-for-vegetable-garden-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">peat moss</a> or well-rotted <a data-ail=""6010"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-manures-for-vegetables-components-of-manure"" target=""_self"">manure</a> to the area for making the bed. Tillage is not being a usual practice in the raised bed. Shape the tilled soil into a flat mound about eight inches high, with sides tapered up at a 45-degree angle. Let the soil rest and settle for a week or two ahead of planting.</p>
<h5><span id=""Containerized_raised_beds""><strong> Containerized raised beds</strong></span></h5>
<p>A raised bed with 10″ to 12″ walls provides more protection to plants they maximize physical accessibility and reduce maintenance these are the preferred setup for<strong><u> raised bed vegetable gardening for beginners</u></strong>. Choose the width to match your arm’s reach. Gardener’s Supply offers a wide variety of raised beds, made up of aluminum corner kits that you can fix on your own, complete raised bed kits in cedar, composite wood, recycled plastic and galvanized steel. You can also consider elevated raised beds, for no-bend gardening.</p>
<p>Raised beds vary in height depending on the requirements of growers, starting at about 6 inches is favorable to perform plantation and related operations. In general, the more soil depth that’s offered to your plants, the more freely their roots will grow. More soil also retains more moisture; hence a deeper raised bed will require less frequent watering. It is promising to install a raised bed on poor or compacted soil, or even on concrete. If this is the situation you have, buy the deepest bed you can manage. Decide the building material for your raised bed untreated rot-resistant wood is the most accepted choice. Like with any other container garden, the soil will settle down and deplete as time passes by. You can lessen this by adding about a 1- to 2-inch layer of compost or composted manure each spring prior to planting.</p>
<h5><span id=""Stacked_Stone_raised_beds""><strong> Stacked Stone raised beds </strong></span></h5>
<p>These raised beds, shown at the height of the growing season, are made from stacked stone. Some gardeners prefer stone to wood for their beds because it requires less maintenance. Moreover, it gives a different look. The only drawback with <strong><u>raised garden bed materials </u></strong>is that the upfront investment is normally more with stone.</p>
<h4><span id=""Irrigation_for_raised_bed_vegetable_gardening""><strong> Irrigation for raised bed vegetable gardening</strong></span></h4>
<p>The best way to monitor soil moisture and when it is time to water is to feel the soil with your hands. When you stick a finger down into the soil, it should feel slightly damp but not soggy or very sticky. Vegetables don’t prefer their soil to be too dry or too wet, so find the right balance. It is more successful to water in the morning so that the soil has all day to dry out and get the perfect moisture.</p>

<p>The following proportion of soil can be followed when constructing a raised bed</p>
<ul>
<li>60% topsoil</li>
<li>30% compost</li>
<li>10% potting soil (a soilless growing mix that contains peat moss, perlite and/or vermiculite)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have quality topsoil available, a suitable alternative can be a 50-50 mixture of soilless growing medium (often known as “<a data-ail=""6010"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/potting-soil-mix-for-vegetables-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">potting soil</a>“) and compost this is the answer to <strong><u>how to fill a raised garden bed cheap</u></strong></p>
<p>. If you want to add peat moss to the bed, it must not be more than 20 percent of the total mix. Peat moss is in nature acidic and is not a good medium for growing vegetables. You can also add <a data-ail=""6010"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/making-vermicompost-at-home-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">vermicompost</a> to the soil for increasing the organic matter.</p>

<p>Raised bed vegetables.Raised bed gardens are one of the most productive and traditional ways to produce your own food. Raised beds can be simple or quite complicated depending on your requirements and the general aesthetic look you wish to create.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raised-bed gardening is a great approach to produce vegetables particularly if the native soil is poor or compacted or has poor drainage.</li>
<li>Prior to establishing the bed, break up and loosen the soil underneath properly with a garden fork so that it’s not compacted for this go about 6 to 8 inches deep. For improved rooting, some gardeners prefer to take away the top layer (about a spade’s depth), dig down another layer, and then shuffle the top layer and mix both layers as one.</li>
<li>For optimal plant health and productivity, most vegetables must obtain at least eight hours of full sun every day. The more sun, the better growth, so it makes sense to establish your raised garden in the sunniest part of your place. Stay away from low, wet areas where the soil possibly will stay soggy. Since your garden will have to be watered during the growing season.</li>
<li>Superior soil quality is the single most vital ingredient for a good garden. Raised beds offer you an immediate advantage over a regular garden, as when you load your raised bed, you can fill up it with a combination of soil that’s superior to native soil. Soil which is loose and packed with rich with nutrients and organic matter will permit the roots of your plants to grow freely, and make sure that they have contact with the water and nutrients they require to maintain healthy growth.</li>
<li>Ahead of placing your raised beds in their permanent site, be sure to eliminate grass or perennial weeds from the area. This will advance drainage and moisture retention in the raised beds.</li>
<li>The shape of your beds can also craft a difference. Raised beds turn out to be more space-efficient by gently rounding the soil to form an arc.</li>
<li>No matter how small or big your garden is you can produce more by going vertical. Grow vining crops like tomatoes, pole beans, peas, squash; melons are the best<strong><u> vegetables to grow in raised beds </u></strong>which can be supported by trellises, fences, cages, or stakes. Growing vegetables vertically saves your time as harvesting and maintenance are faster as you can see exactly where the fruits are and how they are progressing. Fungal diseases are also less likely to attack upward-bound plants due to improved air circulation around the plants.</li>
<li>Mulching is another secret of rich and productive raised beds you can cover the bed with a clear plastic tunnel. When the soil temperature hits 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, set out plants and cover the black plastic mulch with straw to maintain it from trapping too much of heat, to limit evaporation and controlling weeds. Remove the clear plastic tunnel as the air temperature warms and all danger of frost has passed.</li>
<li>If the raised beds are made directly on the soil, line the planting bed using hardware cloth or wire during building time to stop visits from burrowing animals such as gophers and moles.</li>
<li>Assess which direction the sun comes from in respect to your garden and make sure that you don’t plant tall crops in front of shorter ones it’s a basic rule of the plantation.</li>
<li>Material for raised bed can be anything you can build a structure or can directly place it on soil materials like untreated rot-resistant wood is the most popular preference. Make sure to avoid railroad ties or any corrosive material because they are treated and likely to leak toxins into the soil</li>
<li>When preparing the bed avoid stepping on the raised bed, as it will compact the soil.</li>
<li>This is an often asked question <strong><u>what do I put on the bottom of a raised garden bed</u></strong> answer is it is better to line the bottom of your beds with cardboard or newspaper this prevents weeds or grass from growing up through your raised bed.</li>
<li>Grow as much food as achievable but make sure you don’t overlap plants. Overcrowded plants never attain their full potential because they are stressed by poor air circulation and competition for water, nutrients, and root space for their development moreover chances of spreading diseases maximizes.</li>
<li>It’s also important to consider each plant’s growth habit (bushy, climbing, trailing, etc) it affect the growth of its neighboring crop planted in same the bed. For example, growing lettuce next to carrots is okay; but planting lettuce next to a sprawling cucumber plant may be an issue.</li>
<li>Length isn’t as significant typically plots are usually 4 feet wide by 8 feet long or 4 feet wide by 12 feet lengthy. Construct your bed as long as you wish or you can build several raised beds for different crops. The depth of the bed can differ, but 6 inches of soil should be the bare minimum. Most garden plants require at least 6 to 12 inches for their roots, so 12 inches is perfect.</li>

<p>Manure is the decomposed form of dead plants and animals which is useful to the soil to increase production. It is a natural form of fertilizer and it is cost-effective. The human and animal excreta are also used as manure. The livestock manure is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and also potassium. Manure is highly rich in organic matter and humus and therefore improves the soil fertility. This is better in the long run and does not cause any pollution and it is a valuable and renewable resource. Keep reading for best manures for vegetables.</p>

<h4><span id=""Manure_handling_and_field_application_in_vegetables""><strong>Manure handling and field application in vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<p>Livestock manure can be a valuable source of nutrients, but it can be a source of human pathogens if not managed correctly. Organic certification programs currently contain strict requirements on the handling of raw manure. Even though these requirements are designed to minimize environmental risks. It is important that all farms using manure follow excellent agricultural practices to reduce any microbial risk that may exist.</p>
<p>Proper and thorough composting of manure and incorporating it into the soil prior to planting. Avoiding the top-dressing of plants is important in reducing the risk of microbial contamination.</p>
<h4><span id=""Tips_for_avoiding_contamination_by_manure""><strong>Tips for avoiding contamination by manure</strong></span></h4>
<p>There is always a risk when you use manure or manure tea in your <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/starting-a-vegetable-garden-from-scratch-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">vegetable garden</a>, but there are some precautions you can take to keep you and your family safe.</p>
<h4><span id=""Dont_use_fresh_manure""><strong>Don’t use fresh manure</strong></span></h4>
<p>Aside from contamination risk, the fresh manure and more of a probability it will be high in nitrogen and ammonia. This can burn plant roots and even inhibit seed germination. If the manure is from a plant-eating animal, it is probably full of weed seeds, which will not be inhibited from sprouting.</p>
<h4><span id=""Other_ways_to_use_manure_in_the_garden""><strong>Other ways to use manure in the garden</strong></span></h4>
<p>Instead of using manure as a fertilizer in the garden, use it as a soil conditioner. Add fresh manure in the fall for spring planting and it will have time to work into the soil and compost. Wait until all vegetable plants have been harvested before adding it to the soil.</p>
<p>Another choice is to side-dress with composted manure during the growing season. Manure that is composted lessens the risk of contamination, particularly if the pile heats up to 140 degrees or more.</p>
<h4><span id=""Precautions_for_apply_manure_to_vegetables""><strong>Precautions for apply manure to vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<p>Thoroughly wash your hands and nails before and after harvesting make grown with manure. Since root crops such as beets, <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/planting-carrots-in-pots-a-complete-guide"" target=""_self"">carrots</a>, radishes and leafy vegetables such as chard, <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/hydroponic-lettuce-gardening-tips-techniques"" target=""_self"">lettuce</a>, and <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-spinach-in-pots-palakura-in-home-garden"" target=""_self"">spinach</a> are susceptible to contamination, be sure to wash these vegetables well and possibly peel them before eating. Cooking will kill pathogens. If you have been susceptible to foodborne illness in the past, avoid eating uncooked vegetables fertilized with manure.</p>
<h4><span id=""Not_all_manure_is_created_equal""><strong>Not all manure is created equal</strong></span></h4>
<p>The <u>nutrient value of manures</u> varies by animal and chicken manure is considered to be the most beneficial for your garden, with an N-P-K ratio of about 1.1–0.8–0.5. Compare that with cows N-P-K ratio at 0.6–0.2–0.5 and horse manure, 0.7–0.3–0.6. Of course, even within the same species, the quality of the manure will change.</p>
<p>Most sources recommend avoiding the use of pig, cat, and dog manure in the vegetable garden because it may contain parasites that can survive in the soil and infect humans.</p>
<h4><span id=""Wash_and_peel_your_garden_vegetables""><strong>Wash and peel your garden vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<p>All produce must be washed very well before you eat it. The risk of contamination is greatest for crops such as radishes, carrots, and leafy vegetables such as lettuce, where the edible parts touch the soil. Washing vegetables with clean water and peeling will remove most of the pathogens that can cause illness. Fully cooking the vegetables will kill the remaining pathogens.</p>

<h4><span id=""Always_wash_with_clean_potable_water""><strong>Always wash with clean, potable water</strong></span></h4>
<p>Do not use soaps or chlorine washes to wash vegetables. Vegetable wash products are not essential and have not been found to be any more effective than clean water.  When washing vegetables, don’t use water that is colder than the produce by 10°F or more.</p>
<h4><span id=""Components_of_manure""><strong>Components of manure</strong></span></h4>
<h5><span id=""Nutrients""><strong>Nutrients</strong></span></h5>
<p>Manure contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that plants require to grow. Farmers can often save money by appropriately using manure as a fertilizer. Farmers can sell manure or manure products to gardeners, landscapers, golf courses, and others who use nutrients to grow plants. And manure can be land-applied in its raw structure, or after processing (for example, composting, and pelletizing, nutrient extraction). Just like other fertilizer sources, as long as the manure is useful from the right source, at the right rate and time, and in the right place, manure nutrients can be recycled safely through agricultural systems.</p>
<h5><span id=""Organic_Matter""><strong>Organic Matter</strong></span></h5>
<p>Adding manure to soils is an excellent method to increase soil organic matter. Soil organic matter contributes to soil health the soil’s ability and sustainability to function as a living ecosystem. In addition to slowly releasing plant nutrients over time, organic matter improves soil structure and soil’s ability to hold water. Healthier soils develop crop yields and reduce soil loss from both wind and water erosion, and protect water quality by reducing contaminated runoff.</p>
<h5><span id=""Solids""><strong>Solids</strong></span></h5>
<p>Manure begins as mostly water and different types of manure can contain from 8 to 26 percent solids. By separating the liquid manure and solid portions of manure, the solids can be used for other purposes.</p>
<h5><span id=""Energy""><strong>Energy</strong></span></h5>
<p>Manure contains a lot of carbon and other elements that can be used to make different types of biofuels. Anaerobic digestion is a technology that uses microbes to procedure manure into biogas. Biogas can be used to make heat or electricity for use on the farm or sale to the local power grid.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><span id=""Fiber""><strong>Fiber</strong></span></h5>
<p>Manure consists of a great deal of fiber. Some of the fiber is from undigested animal feed and some are from straw, sawdust, or other bedding that obtain mixed in with the manure. Manure fiber has been used to create a number of specialty consumer products such as plant growth medium, seed starter pots, and building materials. Consumer products help turn the manure from a potential environmental liability to a commodity.</p>

<h4><span id=""Applying_best_manures_for_different_vegetables""><strong>Applying best manures for different vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<h5><span id=""Heavy_feeder_vegetables""><strong>Heavy feeder vegetables</strong></span></h5>
<p>Some vegetables are heavy feeders, which means they need lots of nutrients to produce large leaves and fruiting vegetables. Heavy feeders contain <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/container-tomato-gardening-for-beginners"" target=""_self"">tomatoes</a>, cabbage, <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/organic-celery-gardening-in-containers"" target=""_self"">celery</a>, eggplant, squash, <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-pumpkins-from-seed-at-home-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">pumpkins</a>, and melons. If you apply a nitrogen source, such as composted manure, before the vegetable plants bloom, they’ll produce lots of leafy growth, but fewer blossoms and fruit. Give <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/sweet-corn-gardening-tips-ideas-techniques"" target=""_self"">corn</a> an extra helping of composted manure before the stalks make tassels.</p>
<h5><span id=""Leafy_vegetables""><strong>Leafy vegetables</strong></span></h5>
<p>Leafy vegetables that are lettuce, <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-arugula-planting-care-havresting"" target=""_self"">arugula</a>, and <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-kale-planting-care-harvesting-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">kale</a>, are grown for their leaves, so you don’t need to worry about timing nitrogen applications. In fact, these vegetable plants grow best with a few applications of composted manure throughout the growing season. Side dress leafy vegetables with a shovelful of composted manure every month to encourage fast and strong growth.</p>
<h5><span id=""Root_vegetables""><strong>Root vegetables</strong></span></h5>
<p>Skip the extra helpings of manure for the root vegetables. Beyond the annual application to improve soil, these plants don’t need additional composted manure. Excess nitrogen causes leafy growth instead of root development and encourages hairy or split roots. Root vegetables require potassium and phosphorus instead. Organic sources of potassium contain wood ashes, leaf compost, crushed granite, and greensand. Phosphorus is found in bone meal or also in horn meal. You can find commercial <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-fertilizers-for-vegetables-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">fertilizers</a> high in potassium and phosphorus.</p>
<h4><span id=""Manure_handling_before_planting_vegetables""><strong>Manure handling before planting vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Select location for produce based on land history and location</li>
<li>Use careful manure handling and keep good records.</li>
<li>Store manure as far away as practical from places where fresh produce is grown and handled. If manure is not composted, age the manure to be applied to produce fields for at least 6 months prior to application. Where possible, erect physical barriers or wind barriers to prevent runoff and wind drift of manure onto vegetable plants.</li>
<li>Store manure slurry for at least 60 days in the summer season and 90 days in the winter before applying to fields.</li>
<li>High temperatures achieved by well-managed, aerobic compost can kill most harmful pathogens in the gardens. Remember to optimize temperature, turning, and time to make high quality, stable compost.</li>

<p>There are a few things to be cautious of when adding manure to your vegetable garden;</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use dog or cat manure in your vegetable garden. While you may think this must be common sense, it needs to be said because of the high risk of diseases being transferred to humans from the feces of dogs and cats.</li>
<li>Remember not to use fresh manure in your vegetable garden while you have live plants in there. The high nitrogen and ammonia levels can kill your vegetable plants at the root. While cow manure won’t burn anything, you can obtain weeds and grasses transferred to your soil.</li>
<li>Never use manure from a sick or diseased animal in the garden. Not even composting it, remove it from homestead to prevent the spread of disease or sickness.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""Safe_gardening_manure_practices""><strong>Safe gardening manure practices</strong></span></h4>
<p>To reduce the risk of disease transmissions follow these safe gardening practices;</p>
<p><strong>Use composted manure</strong> – Composting manure with your yard and vegetable garden waste helps reduce the risk of contaminating your garden vegetables with pathogens. Ensuring that the compost pile reaches a temperature of 140°F will further reduce the risk. Commercially processed manure, obtainable in garden centers, should indicate on the package if it is pathogen-free.</p>
<p><strong>Never use cat, dog, or pig manure in vegetable gardens or compost piles</strong> – Parasites that could be in these types of manure are more likely to survive and infect people than those in other types of manure. It is important to keep your pets out of your vegetable garden.</p>
<p><strong>Use water that meets safe drinking standards to irrigate your vegetables</strong> – This is important within one month of harvest. If you use any water that is not drinkable (potable), such as water from old dug wells or rain barrels, to irrigate your vegetable garden, it is best to use <a data-ail=""4765"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/garden-drip-system-advantages-and-disadvantages"" target=""_self"">drip</a> or trickle irrigation system to both conserve water and minimize the contamination of leafy vegetables that can occur with overhead irrigation.</p>
<h4><span id=""Plan_best_manures_application_timing_carefully_in_vegetables""><strong>Plan best manures application timing carefully in vegetables</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Apply manure in the fall or at the end of the season to all planned vegetable ground or fruit acreage and preferably when soils are warm, non-saturated, and cover-cropped.</li>
<li>If applying manure in the spring (or the start of a season), spread the manure 2 weeks before planting, preferably to grain or forage crops.</li>
<li>Do not harvest vegetable plants until 120 days after manure.</li>
<li>Remember to document rates, dates, and locations of manure applications in vegetable plants. Incorporate manure into the garden soil.</li>
<li>Incorporate manure after application. Although it is known that several harmful pathogens do not survive long in the soil, research is still needed on soil microbes and pathogen interactions. Some pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, could survive and grow in the soil.</li>
<li>If it is necessary to apply manure or slurry to vegetable ground, incorporate it at least 2 weeks prior to planting and observe the suggested 120-day pre-harvest interval.</li>
<li>If the 120-day waiting period is not feasible, such as for short-season crops like lettuce or leafy greens, apply properly composted manure.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all folks about best manures for vegetables, hope you enjoyed, we wish you all the best for growing vegetables.</p>
