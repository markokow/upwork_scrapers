Squashes include both winter and summer Squash types. Due to soft and <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-succulent-plants-in-pots-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">succulent</a> natures, they are vulnerable to a range of Squash diseases that need treatment and care. Squash plants produce yellow or orange color flowers and green, white or yellow fruit in a variety of shapes and sizes with smooth or ridged skin.</p>
<h3><span id=""A_guide_to_squash_plant_diseases_pests""><strong>A guide to squash plant diseases, pests</strong></span></h3>
<p>Squash is divided into two categories;</p>
<ul>
<li>Summer Squash</li>
<li>Winter Squash</li>
</ul>
<p>Summer Squash plant grows quickly in about 60 days and harvested throughout the summer while still young. Their skins are thin and tender and tend to be prolific producers. Zucchini is the most common summer Squash plant and pattypan is another equally tasty variety. Summer varieties of Squash are very large and bushy.</p>
<p>Winter Squash grow slowly (80 to 110 days) and often mature to a rich color before harvest. Their skins are thicker and protective, making them last longer in storage. Well-known winter Squashes consist of pumpkin, Hubbard, and butternut.</p>

<h4><span id=""Requirements_for_growing_squash""><strong>Requirements for growing squash</strong></span></h4>
<p>Squash requires lots of sunlight and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 25°C (65–75°F). Squash will yield best if grown in fertile, well-draining <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/preparing-soil-for-vegetable-garden-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">soil</a>, rich in organic matter and with a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5. Squash must be planted in full sun and provided with ample soil moisture due to its shallow root system.</p>

<p>The Squash planting site needs to receive full sun; the soil must be moist and well-drained, but not soggy. Squash can be sown directly into the garden. Summer Squash and Winter Squash are commonly planted in hills about 1 inch deep. Sow seeds after any danger of frost have ended and the soil has warmed. Usually, 4 to 5 seeds per hill are plenty, thinning down to 2 or 3 plants per hill once the seedlings have developed their true leaves. Hills and rows of summer Squash must be approximately 3 to 4 feet apart while winter Squash should be spaced about 4 to 5 feet apart with 5 to 7 feet between rows and with the hills spaced 3 feet apart.</p>
<p>Squash plants need one inch of water per week. To put that into perspective, you’ll want to water mature Squash plants once a week so the soil is moist 8 to 12 inches beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Squash plants can be started indoors 3 to 4 weeks before the planting date. Start seeds in peat pots but be sure the seedlings do not suffer root disturbances during transplanting. And you can plant 3 to 4 seeds per pot and thin to 2 plants later. <u>Harvesting Squash</u> is ready to harvest stage when the rind is hard and cannot be punctured with a fingernail. The skin of mature fruits is dull and dry in appearance, particularly when compared with the shiny skin of immature fruit.</p>
<h4><span id=""Common_pests_diseases_effects_and_their_control_in_Squash_plants""><strong>Common pests, diseases effects and their control in Squash plants</strong></span></h4>
<h5><span id=""Squash_vine_borers""><strong>Squash vine borers</strong></span></h5>
<p>Squash vine borers tunnel through the stems of Squash plants, depriving the plant leaves and fruit of moisture. Squash vine borer moths hatch out of overwintering cocoons in the soil. These red bodied, wasp-like moths lay reddish-brown color eggs around the stem close to the soil line. Deter moths by covering the base of the stems near the ground with soil, <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/garden-mulching-types-techniques-and-ideas"" target=""_self"">mulch</a>, foil, and fabric material. You can inject the stem with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to kill the larvae, or by using a sanitized knife to cut above the entry hole, remove the larvae.</p>
<h5><span id=""Squash_End_Rot""><strong>Squash End Rot</strong></span></h5>
<p>One of the most <u>common diseases in the Squash plant</u> is the Squash end rot. This is a calcium deficiency disease that causes blossom end rot in <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/container-tomato-gardening-for-beginners"" target=""_self"">tomatoes</a>. Too little calcium causes the Squash plant problems in building fruit cells. As a result, the bottom of the Squash fruit often does not get enough calcium. This problem doesn’t appear until the fruit becomes larger. Prevention is better than cure, and the only real solution is to remove the rotting fruit and add a calcium-rich supplement to the Squash plant. New fruit must begin to grow shorter and the plant should now have enough calcium to prevent Squash rot from forming.</p>
<h5><span id=""Aphids""><strong>Aphids</strong></span></h5>
<p>Another common garden pest that can feast on Squash is the lowly aphid. In many cases, <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/garden-aphids-control-methods-a-complete-guide"" target=""_self"">aphids</a> will damage a handful of plants before becoming a meal for beneficial insects such as ladybugs and wasps. Neem oil is effective at controlling aphids when applied according to product instructions.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><span id=""Squash_bugs_and_cucumber_beetles""><strong>Squash bugs and cucumber beetles</strong></span></h5>
<p>Like other Squash plant varieties, crookneck Squash will most likely be plagued with Squash bugs. Squash bugs can quickly take over the Squash plant affect fruit set and quality. They feed on plants by piercing the leaves and stem with their mouthparts causing wilting even when well-watered.</p>
<p>In case if you miss this: <a data-mil=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/capsicum-seed-germination-time-period-bell-pepper""><strong><span style=""color: #0000ff;"">Capsicum Seed Germination Process</span></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Generally, <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-cucumbers-in-pots-from-seed-cucumber-care"" target=""_self"">cucumber</a> beetles are smaller than Squash bugs. They are yellow and black with stripes or spots like a ladybug. These pests are vectors for many diseases we will talk about so controlling pests is the best way to prevent fatal infections in your plants. <u>Controlling Squash bugs without using pesticides</u> is the difficult aspect of <u>growing crookneck Squash</u>. Cucumber beetles look like ladybugs but are yellow with black dots or yellow with black stripes. Both beetles spread diseases like bacterial wilt and controlled as soon as possible.</p>
<h4><span id=""Tips_to_Control_Squash_bugs""><strong>Tips to Control Squash bugs</strong></span></h4>
<p>Attempts at <u>preventing Squash bugs</u> seem to work best if treatment takes place when the plants are young and when they are flowering. Early detection of Squash bug nymphs is important. Once you have a big infestation of adults, they can be difficult to kill.</p>
<h5><span id=""Garden_Cleanliness""><strong>Garden Cleanliness</strong></span></h5>
<p>The adult Squash bugs are attracted by garden refuse.  Remove vines, leaves and plant debris in the last fall and then destroy it. This will ensure that there will not be areas in the garden that attract the bugs when it is time to plant your garden. Time spent cleaning away vines and dead plants in fall will reward you with fewer disease problems next year. Garden refuse can be recycled in a compost pile, but don’t have it too close to the areas where you will be planting your Squash. Don’t compost dead plants in the fall. Those little pests tend to overwinter and cause trouble all over again the next growing season.</p>
<h5><span id=""Practice_crop_rotation""><strong>Practice crop rotation</strong></span></h5>
<p>Many garden problems occur when you plant the vegetables in your garden in the same spot each year. Instead, rotate the crops, so that the bugs and diseases don’t get a chance to take hold.</p>
<h5><span id=""Leaf-footed_bugs""><strong>Leaf-footed bugs</strong></span></h5>
<p>Leaf-footed bugs will feed on Squash plants. They are just about as bad as Squash bugs or maybe worse as they seem to feed on all sorts of veggies. <u>Controlling leaf-footed bugs</u> in Squash plants is no different from Squash bug control.</p>
<h5><span id=""Squash_vine_borers1""><strong>Squash vine borers</strong></span></h5>
<p>The Squash vine borer is also another pest that can kill young Squash plants. These caterpillars live in the soil and bore into the stalk of Squash plants causing it to wilt and die. To <u>prevent Squash vine borers</u>, you can wrap the stem of young plants with aluminum foil, plastic cups, or another type of barrier to prevent access to the base of your plant.</p>
<h5><span id=""Powdery_mildew_of_Squash_plant_diseases""><strong>Powdery mildew of Squash plant diseases</strong></span></h5>
<p>If you notice your Squash plants are wilting and have a thin white film growing on the surface of the leaves, then you have <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/powdery-mildew-symptoms-and-control-methods"" target=""_self"">powdery mildew</a>. Powdery mildew is a fungal infection that can overwhelm and kill your Squash plant by blocking out sunlight. Powdery mildew shows up in the hot dry periods of summer and will affect <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-pumpkins-from-seed-at-home-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">pumpkins</a> and cucumbers. The white powdery growth of the fungus will appear on all parts of the Squash plant, and leaves will begin to turn yellow. It is easiest to prevent powdery mildew by not crowding your plants and applying horticultural oil like <a data-ail=""5229"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/neem-oil-pesticide-formulation-for-garden-plants"" target=""_self"">neem oil</a>. Neem oil treatments can help treat mild and early powdery mildew infections.</p>
<h5><span id=""Downy_mildew_of_Squash_plant_diseases""><strong>Downy mildew of Squash plant diseases</strong></span></h5>
<p>Downy mildew is a different fungal disease of the Squash plant that causes a velvety type growth on the undersides of the leaves. It does not have the white appearance that powdery mildew does, but has a fluffy, grey-colored growth. Downy mildew causes brown and yellow spotting on the leaves that appear similar to mosaic viral infections. In contrast to powdery mildew, downy mildew prefers a cool and wet environment. Though, you can have both types of mildew affecting your plants at the same time. The best practice for <u>preventing mildew infections in the Squash plant</u> is the application of Neem oil every 7 to 10 days. It’s important to repeat the treatments as they do not have a long residual effect.</p>
<h4><span id=""Organic_pest_control_options_for_Squash_plants""><strong>Organic pest control options for Squash plants</strong></span></h4>
<h5><span id=""Row_covers""><strong>Row covers</strong></span></h5>
<p>Row covers are a good way to prevent an infestation with Squash bugs, but you’ll want to cover your plants as soon as you put them out. Plus you’ll be hand-pollinating flowers as the covers prevent good bugs from getting in as well.</p>
<h5><span id=""Insecticidal_soaps""><strong>Insecticidal soaps</strong></span></h5>
<p>Insecticidal soaps can be effective if applied correctly. To obtain the most benefit, spray as it cools down in the evening. This is when Squash bugs are active and pollinators are less active. Insecticidal soaps need to coat the Squash bugs to be effective. During the day, the bugs hide in the debris under the plant so spraying during this time is not the best use of time. Don’t spray the top of your Squash plant; make sure you’re coating the undersides of plant leaves and around the base of the plant.</p>
<h5><span id=""Hand-picking""><strong>Hand-picking</strong></span></h5>
<p>Hand-picking and squishing the Squash bug eggs is one of the good ways to control Squash bug numbers. Scrape, squish, or remove the seeds with duct tape when you discover them. Stomp, smush, or drown adults as catch them. Be aware that they stink to high heaven when killed.</p>
<h5><span id=""Companion_planting""><strong>Companion planting</strong></span></h5>
<p>It can be beneficial to plant certain flowers and veggies with Squash plants to encourage beneficial insects and possibly repel pests. Flowers such as nasturtium and marigold are said to repel Squash bugs and beetles.</p>

<p>Squash plant growing success will come with a few simple growing strategies;</p>
<p><strong>Plant several Squash plants</strong> – This will ensure at least one is successful and survives pests and diseases in plants. Stagger planting times or plant seeds and transplants at the same time for the continuous harvest.</p>
<p><strong>Give Squash space recommended</strong> – Check spacing requirements for each plant variety you grow. If the garden is tight, contain the plant by pinching out the plant growing tips after a vine has set a few fruits. Don’t grow Squash plants too close together; this will help deter pests and diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Pick Squash at the correct time</strong> – Pick summer Squashes when they are young. Let winter Squashes mature until their rinds are dull and hard. Pick any fruit that is discolored or rotting before other plants or fruits are affected.</p>

<p>Coco coir is a popular type of <u>hydroponic growing medium</u>. There are a whole host of benefits to growing with Coconut coir that you can and must take advantage of if you’re new to <a data-ail=""5187"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/starting-hydroponics-gardening-at-home"" target=""_self"">hydroponics</a>. Coco coir has a neutral pH level. The pH of the coir is a huge benefit while peat moss is considered acidic with a pH of 3.3 to 4; coco coir is closer to an ideal, neutral pH between 5.2 and 6.8. This means Coco coir is ready to use for several plants without adding <a data-ail=""5187"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-lemon-tree-in-pots-indoors-balcony-terrace"" target=""_self"">lime</a>. Nutritionally, coco is also a good choice.<strong> </strong></p>

<h4><span id=""Mix_Coconut_coir_and_Soil""><strong>Mix Coconut coir and Soil</strong></span></h4>
<p>Mixing Coco coir with soil works great because;</p>
<ul>
<li>Coconut coir improves soil aeration and moisture retention.</li>
<li>It loosens the texture of clay soil and also improves drainage.</li>
<li>Coconut coir allows the sandy soil to hold on to water longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, submerge the coir brick in a bucket of water. The instructions in the package will tell you how much water to use for the brick size you purchase. Alternatively, you can purchase a Coco coir that has already had the water added.</p>
<p>Scoop the hydrated coir with hands and mix it around until the fibers separate and the coir is loose and fluffy. Then, it is now ready to mix with soil.</p>
<p>Carefully add equal parts coir and soil in a container. Add one part compost to fertilize if desired. Stir the components until they are well-mixed. You can vary the amounts of each part used to get the desired consistency and then you can also add 1 part <a data-ail=""5187"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/hydroponics-perlite-growing-medium-advantages"" target=""_self"">perlite</a> or vermiculite for better drainage. Use the soil mixture for <u>potting container plants</u> or sandy soils for outdoor ground plants.</p>
<h4><span id=""Coconut_coir_making""><strong>Coconut coir making</strong></span></h4>
<p>Coconut coir comes from the fibrous coconut husks inside of coconut shells. This strong and helpful by-product is sourced for the production of several different products. Among them are Upholstery stuffing, Plant basket liners, Doormats, Brushes, Ropes, and Rugs.</p>
<p>Coco coir is an extremely durable, rot-resistant, fibrous material making for a good material to use in producing products with plenty of exposure to water and used outdoors. Coco peat is a popular material found in potting mixes, as a propagation medium and a soil amendment. To get Coconut coir ready for <a data-ail=""5187"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/starting-hydroponics-gardening-at-home"" target=""_self"">hydroponic gardening</a> uses, it needs to go through extensive processing.</p>
<p>Initially, they need to remove the coir from the coconuts. And this is done by soaking the husks in water to loosen and soften them. This is done in tidal waters or freshwater. If done in tidal waters, the Coconut coir will take up a large amount of salt, which will want to be flushed out by the manufacturer at a later stage.</p>
<p>Then, they are removed from the water bath and dried for over a year. After the drying procedure, which is quite extensive, the coir is organized into bales. These bales are then chopped and processed into several formats, from chips, to “croutons”, to classic ground Coconut coir.</p>
<h4><span id=""Coco_coir_better_than_peat_moss""><strong>Coco coir better than peat moss</strong></span></h4>
<p>There are many good <u>reasons to choose Coco coir over peat moss</u> for gardening and potting mix, and naturally, peat moss has no place in hydroponics. The first and foremost reason to choose Coco coir is that it is a renewable resource. <u>Choosing Coco coir over peat moss</u> helps stop the destruction of ecologically fragile peat bogs.</p>
<p>And the source for peat moss comes from decomposed plant matter accumulated in waterlogged soil for centuries. The destruction of a peat bog can happen in a matter of weeks, it will not renew itself for many lifetimes. Coco coir, as a byproduct of coconut harvest, is entirely sustainable. Using Coco coir in your garden prevents it from taking up space in the landfill, where it can take more than a century to break down.</p>

<p>Neutral Coco coir pH level comes with several advantages over peat moss. It is hospitable to several varieties of plants and easier to amend with nutrients. More fruits and vegetables prefer more alkaline soil. When you start with <u>Coconut coir as a growing medium</u>, you will not want to amend with lime to produce these results.</p>
<h4><span id=""Adding_nutrients_to_coco_coir""><strong>Adding nutrients to coco coir</strong></span></h4>
<p>Coco coir does contain these nutrients;</p>
<ul>
<li>Manganese</li>
<li>Potassium</li>
<li>Copper</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Zinc</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite rich in potassium, so when selecting fertilizer you may want to choose a product that has relatively low potassium content. And the other nutrients are negligible, but they do add some benefit.</p>
<p>Coir pH level is fairly neutral, so you may not want to use it for blueberries, flowering Azalea plants and other types of plants that prefer acidic soil. For these types of plants, you may wish to continue amending with peat moss.</p>
<h4><span id=""Coco_coir_types""><strong>Coco coir types</strong></span></h4>
<p>Types of Coco coir</p>
<p>When you buy a Coconut coir product, you’re buying three <u>types of Coconut coir</u>;</p>
<ul>
<li>Coco fiber,</li>
<li>Coco pith (or coconut peat),</li>
<li>Coco chips</li>
</ul>

<p>Coconut fiber adds air pockets into the medium. It’s not very absorbent, which is good because growing media needs air pockets to provide oxygen to the root zone. Coconut fibers do break down rather quickly though, meaning the air pockets they create will decrease over time.</p>
<p>Coir fibers are the fibers separated from the rest of the coir and they can help improve the air holding capacity of your <u>hydroponic growing media</u>. But they degrade pretty quickly in water.</p>
<h4><span id=""Coco_Pith_or_coco_peat""><strong>Coco Pith or coco peat</strong></span></h4>
<p>The “peat” of Coconut coir, basically looks like finely ground coconut or peat moss. It is so small and absorbent that if you were to use coco peat as your only growing medium, you might drown out the roots of your plants. It should be aged properly to be used as a growing medium, as it can let out salts that will kill your plant if you’re not careful. Choosing a Coconut coir manufacturer that age properly is crucial for good growth.</p>
<h4><span id=""Coco_chips""><strong>Coco chips</strong></span></h4>
<p>Coconut chips are a natural type of expanded clay pellet. They are just made from plant matter instead of clay. They are best thought of as a hybrid between coco peat and also coco fiber. They’re large enough to create air pockets, but absorb water so your plants won’t dehydrate completely.</p>

<p>Coir Chips act as a natural alternative to clay pellets but unlike the pellets, they will degrade naturally. They are versatile because they can hold both air pockets as well as water.</p>
<p>Based on the maturity of the coir fibers at the time of harvest, Coco coir can be divided into two types;</p>
<ul>
<li>White coir</li>
<li>Brown coir</li>
</ul>
<p>White coir is made from young, immature fibers. It is less durable.</p>
<p>Brown coir is from mature fibers, this variety is stronger and more durable.</p>
<p>Brown coir is better for use in gardens and hydroponics systems due to its superior quality and strength.</p>
<h4><span id=""Using_and_benefits_of_coconut_coir_in_hydroponic_gardening""><strong>Using and benefits of coconut coir in hydroponic gardening</strong></span></h4>
<p>Natural Coconut coir and organic Coconut coir makes transitioning from soil to hydroponic gardening easy as it handles just like regular potting soils. When shopping is sure to select the right type of coir for your purpose. You will find products packaged for garden, ornamental and <a data-ail=""5187"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/starting-hydroponics-gardening-at-home"" target=""_self"">hydroponic garden</a> use. Coconut coir prepared for hydroponic gardening has the sodium and potassium removed to give a completely nutrient-neutral medium. This gives you complete control over the nutrient uptake of plants.</p>
<p>Take special care when preparing Coco coir for use in hydroponics. The ornamental variety is quite inexpensive, it is not suitable for hydroponic or food production use as it may contain higher salt levels.</p>
<p><strong>How to use coco coir</strong></p>
<p>In your garden or your potted plants, you can mix up to 40% coir with your soil or potting mix. If you make your seed starting mix for starting small seeds it is best to use fine pith Coconut coir.</p>
<p>Coco coir is nice on its own but even better when combined with other amendments such as rice hulls and perlite. Using them in combination will give you the best results in drainage, aeration, and water retention. Coir also makes great worm bin bedding.</p>
<p><strong>Coconut coir benefits for gardening </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This fibrous material is low-acid with a pH level of 5.2-6.8 (as compared with peat, which ranges between 3.5 and 4.5).</li>
<li>When dry, it soaks up water eagerly, thus it helps plants recover quickly from dry conditions and makes good use of available water.</li>
<li>Absorbs ten times its weight in water, so it keeps roots well hydrated and provides a good growing medium for the healthy development of roots.</li>
<li>Coco coir is a natural weed-free and soil-free product that smells good too.</li>
<li>As a soil amendment coir adds organic matter.</li>
<li>Coco coir helps to improve soil structure.</li>
<li>Coco coir improves water holding capacity acts as a sponge to hold water in the root zone so that the plants can use it when they need it. And it has a better water holding capacity than most soil amendments and it can hold 7 to 10 times its weight.</li>
<li>Good transition from soil gardening means growing in Coco coir feels like growing in soil because the two media look so similar. And you can have a completely hydroponic garden that looks almost the same as a soil garden. The only difference is instead of watering with only water, you had water your Coconut coir garden with nutrient-enriched water.</li>
<li>Retains moisture and provides a good environment that means– Coco coir is one of the most effective growing media for water retention out there. It can absorb up to 10 times its weight in water, meaning the roots of your plants will never get dehydrated. There is also a lot of growing media for roots to work through, promoting healthy root development.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id=""Coco_coir_good_for_plants""><strong>Coco coir good for plants</strong></span></h4>
<p>Coco coir is an excellent medium for growing plants because it is light in weight and can hold a lot of water. As a seed germination Coco coir is excellent.</p>
<h4><span id=""Applications_of_coconut_coir_in_gardening""><strong>Applications of coconut coir in gardening</strong></span></h4>
<p>Coco coir is an excellent soil enhancer. In gardening, you can use Coconut coir to make a good potting mix and to improve the soil quality in your garden. But rarely will you find Coco coir in ready to use format. After getting the Coco coir you have to first prepare it for plants.</p>
<p>Coco coir is a good growing medium for plants. And it can be a good component for a high-quality potting mix. Most of the potting mixes obtainable in the market still use peat moss as the base component. If you make your <a data-ail=""5187"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/potting-soil-mix-for-vegetables-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">potting soil</a>, you can replace peat moss with a greener alternative to the Coco coir. Coco coir is also a great choice as seed starters due to its organic and sterile nature. You can use Coco coir to amend garden soil quality and the coir has an amazing water retention capacity.</p>
<h4><span id=""As_a_garden_soil_additive""><strong>As a garden soil additive</strong></span></h4>
<p>In outdoor gardening, Coconut coir is a good addition to all types of soil and it has excellent water holding and aerating capabilities. It can be used whole or as one of its above mentioned several byproducts. In clayey soil, Coconut coir has a lightening effect. In sandy soil, Coconut coir helps retain water more efficiently. Generally, Coconut coir helps improve soil drainage and water retention.</p>
<h4><span id=""As_a_component_in_soilless_potting_mixes""><strong>As a component in soilless potting mixes</strong></span></h4>
<p>The same reasons that make it a good additive to garden soil also make coir a fantastic component in homemade soil mixes. Major manufacturers these days add coir in some form to their mixes.</p>
<h4><span id=""A_better_alternative_to_peat_moss""><strong>A better alternative to peat moss</strong></span></h4>
<p>Coco coir is increasingly viewed as a desirable alternative to peat moss and peat bogs are a nonrenewable source of peat. Coco coir is a byproduct of coconut farming, which is a far more eco-friendly source. Coir has some clear advantages over peat. For starters, it is easier to manipulate and work with. Coir has a very neutral pH level, which makes it better for a wider variety of plants. This means that coir teams up better with nutrients than peat. Though peat at times feels water-resistant, coir practically acts like a sponge. And it is better than peat in handling water.</p>

<p>Today, we learn the topic of making liquid <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-fertilizers-for-vegetables-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">fertilizers</a> for your home garden. Liquid fertilizer for the garden plant is fast-acting. <u>Liquid fertilizer</u> can be faster acting than a dry or granular fertilizer because the fertilizer has already dissolved into the liquid and hence plants will take it up quickly in larger quantities. The use of liquid fertilizer is now very important due to the new systems of faring such as the hydroponic system. Fertilizer function is a very crucial way of increasing crop yield; not only the crops benefit, but the <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/preparing-soil-for-vegetable-garden-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">soil</a> also advantages in case of organic fertilizer.</p>
<p>Home gardeners use liquid fertilizer as they are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe</li>
<li>Used in many more ways than dry chemical fertilizers</li>
<li>Produce results faster</li>
</ul>
<p>For these above reasons, many homeowners believe liquid plant foods are improved fertilizer than those made as granular fertilizers, like those used in a liquid grass fertilizer. One can grow good quality produce right from their home garden if they are aware of making liquid fertilizers at home.</p>
<p><strong><u>Make liquid fertilizer from dry fertilizer:</u></strong></p>
<p><u>How to turn a dry organic fertilizer blend into a liquid fertilizer?</u> The method is very simple. You simply soak granular organic fertilizer in water, let it sit for 24 hours, and strain out the liquids. This works equally as well for store-bought granular <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/organic-gardening-fertilizers-manures"" target=""_self"">organic fertilizers</a> as it does for homemade fertilizer recipes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use one cup of fertilizer for each gallon of water.</li>
<li>Soak the fertilizer in the water, and allow it to sit for 24 hours. Stir periodically.</li>
<li>Strain out the solids, and use the liquid as a fertilizer at a rate of one to two cups per perennial, 2 to 4 cups per shrub, or 6 to 8 cups for trees.</li>
<li>The liquid can be used full strength for foliar feeding or spraying on leaves or can be diluted with a small quantity of water to make sure the entire root zone of the plant is evenly covered. For container plantings, for example, I would use 1 to 2 cups per gallon and basically soak the entire pot.</li>
<li>There is no want to waste the solids, which still have nutrient value. Use them as a low powered fertilizer on established landscape plantings which need a mild boost.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Homemade liquid fertilizer from vegetable scraps</u></strong></p>
<p>The ingredients used for homemade liquid fertilizer from vegetable scraps are; vegetable scraps, Epsom salt, and water.</p>
<p>Start by saving all cooked or raw vegetable scraps. Save them in the freezer. You can save the water from boiling pasta or vegetables, which is also a good source of nutrients. To create the “scrap puree” which will form the base for your fertilizer, thaw frozen scraps and puree them in a blender with enough water to make a smooth consistency. Pour the pureed scraps into a large bucket. For every blender-full of puree scrap, add 1/2 tsp Epson salt and one capful of ammonia to the bucket. Repeat this procedure until all your scraps are pureed. Stir the bucket and allow it to sit overnight. To combine up a batch of liquid fertilizer, add one quart of puree to one gallon of warm water, and shake to mix. Apply to the soil at the base of plants. Steeping time required for this vegetable scraps is twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><strong><u>Homemade liquid fertilizer from weeds and yard trimmings</u></strong></p>
<p>The ingredients used for homemade liquid fertilizer from weeds, yard trimmings, mowed grass, and water.</p>
<p>Choose freshly pulled or plucked weeds from garden trimmings such as <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/container-tomato-gardening-for-beginners"" target=""_self"">tomato</a> suckers work as well and put a few handfuls in a five-gallon bucket. Load it into the rest of the way up with water, and leave it to steep for the allotted time. The steeping procedure is best done outside, as it can get a little smelly. When ready, affect the soil at the base of your plants. Steeping time required for this procedure will be approximately four weeks.</p>
<p><strong><u>Homemade liquid fertilizer from <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-manures-for-vegetables-components-of-manure"" target=""_self"">manure</a></u></strong></p>
<p>If you live in an agricultural region, or if you have livestock of your own, you can make a truly exceptional liquid fertilizer from livestock manure. This process required a bucket, some water, and a shovelful of manure, steep for four weeks and apply to the soil at the base of your plants. While it might sound disgusting, manure is incredibly high in nitrogen and the ultimate “waste” product. Finding a use for the stuff is actually rewarding. Steeping time required for this procedure will be approximately four weeks.</p>

<p>Liquid fertilizer can be made from two major sources; plant and animal; they are easy to create and the steps involved in making any of these liquid fertilizers are simple to carry out.</p>
<p><strong>How to make liquid fertilizer from animal materials?</strong></p>
<p>Animal liquid fertilizer can be prepared from farm animal waste or dung. You can use any of poultry, goat and sheep or cattle dung to create tea fertilizer. You will require a big drum or tank to prepare your fertilizer; also, you need a permeable sack, a wooden rod, a long rope, and a large stone.</p>
<p>Sundry the animal manure and collect all in the permeable sack. Put the large stone in the sack with the <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/best-manures-for-vegetables-components-of-manure"" target=""_self"">manures</a>. Fill the drum or tank with water, if possible to more than half of the tank.</p>
<p>Put the sack inside the tank with the rope tied to the top of the sack at one end and to the rod at the other end such that the rod provides as an anchor to suspend the sack in the tank with the aid of the rope. You can cover the tank with a cloth or fly net to avoid unruly interference by flies. Stir the water every day for about ten days. By then, liquid fertilizer is ready for use.</p>
<p><strong>How to make liquid fertilizer with plant materials?</strong></p>
<p><u>Plant liquid fertilizer</u> is prepared from plant materials; you can use any plant for this purpose. You want the plant leaves, you can use more than one plant leaves say grass-legume combination to have a mixture of nutrients. You need wood ash to supply the minerals and acts as a <u><a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/pest-repellent-plants-guide-for-your-garden"" target=""_self"">pest repellent</a></u>. Other materials needed are permeable sack, long rope, wooden rod, tank, and stone; as used in the <u>animal liquid fertilizer process</u>.</p>
<p>The procedure is the same as the animal source, but you have to work on the leaves before adding to the sack. You are required to chop the leaves into fine pieces before adding to sack. After adding the chopped leaves into the sack, insert the wood ash and mix with the leaves vigorously for even distribution.</p>
<p>Add the stone inside the sack to stop the sack from floating. Tight the top of the sack with the rope as completed in the animal source; fill the tank with water and insert the sack in the water as directed in the animal liquid fertilizer. Cover the tank with a cloth or fly net as directed above; stir every morning till about ten days. Then, your plant liquid fertilizer is ready for use.</p>

<p><strong><u>Types of liquid fertilizer</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Compost Tea</strong></p>
<p>Compost tea is a way to make the most of all that compost we are making from kitchen scraps and household waste. It’s a method of gleaning much of the nutritional goodness of compost into a ready-made spray. For those without enough compost on hand to cover the total garden, this is a great option. Vermicompost fertilizer also works great.</p>
<p>It begins with finished compost that is the very old stuff that has completely broken down into beautiful richness. This ensures pathogens won’t be a problem. To make the tea, basically, fill a five-gallon bucket a third of the way with the compost and then the remainder of the way with water (harvested rainwater is best.) This must steep for three days and be stirred at least a few times a day. Then, the compost can be strained out and the mixture diluted (10:1, water for tea) to be sprayed onto all plants. It’s very good for watering seedlings.</p>
<p><strong>Green Tea</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, old grass clippings and weeds create a wonderful fertilizer. The fresh or green clippings are full of nitrogen and phosphorus, two mineral components used in the famous NPK blends of typical fertilizers (the other being potassium, which can come from organic <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/growing-banana-in-containers-a-full-guide"" target=""_self"">banana</a> peels.) Comfrey makes fantastic green tea for the plants.</p>
<p>For this tea, we’ll require filling that five-gallon bucket two-thirds of the way with fresh grass clippings, and maybe some organic banana peels, before adding the water. Then, again, let it steep for 3 days, stirring as often as possible. Strain the solid bits out of the tea, and combine it with equal parts of water to apply in the garden, especially leafy crops.</p>
<p><strong>Fish Pond Water</strong></p>
<p>Fish ponds, for those who have them, are a great supply of nitrogen-rich water to go into the garden. Combine fertilizes with the regular cleaning cycle, and both the plants and animals will truly benefit. Plus, it’ll be some efficient multi-tasking for the homeowner or gardener.</p>
<p>In this case, it is important to be sure that the water isn’t treated, and obviously, it is important to look out for the small fishes and other aquatic life, as they might not like to be earthbound. Then, apply the water quantity as is. The fish manure has already been diluted by the water in the tank or in the pond.</p>
<p><strong>Seaweed Soup</strong></p>
<p>Seaweed is a highly respected terrestrial garden addition, as it adds all of the valuable minerals of the sea, a whole host of trace elements that will maintain our food rich in nutrients. Though seaweed is often useful for gardens as amazing <a data-ail=""483"" href=""https://gardeningtips.in/garden-mulching-types-techniques-and-ideas"" target=""_self"">mulch</a>, it can be used to make liquid tea, what we are calling seaweed soup, as well.</p>
<p>Seaweed is available at garden centers, but it can be harvested responsibly, i.e. in moderation from mid-beach spots, where it has washed ashore far sufficient to dry out a bit but not so far as to become infested with bugs. Rinse the seaweed to eliminate some of the salt before filling our five-gallon bucket with it. This time it must steep for at least a couple of weeks prior to straining out the seaweed, which can then be used as mulch.</p>
<p>That’s all folks about making liquid fertilizers for your garden. Keep Gardening!.</p>
