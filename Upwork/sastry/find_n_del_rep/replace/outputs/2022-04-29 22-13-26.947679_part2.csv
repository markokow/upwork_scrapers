<p>In addition to their nutritional value, eggs can provide structure, leavening, richness, color, and flavor to baked products. The height and texture of baked goods is determined by the balance between eggs and flour which provide strength, and sugar and fat which add tenderness.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_makes_bread_moist_and_fluffy""></span>What makes bread moist and fluffy?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When there is steam outside the crust, the steam creates a barrier and the moisture inside the loaf is preserved. The longer you steam the bread the thicker the skin. The skin becomes softer and more fluffy and the crust is built which is impotent because one of its functions is to hold moisture inside the loaf.</p>

<p>Too much flour and not enough water can cause crumbly bread – people often do this if the dough is too sticky and they add more flour rather than kneading through it. Other culprits can be overproving or not kneading enough – the things you need to do to get a good structure.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-is-unsalted-butter-used-in-recipes/,Question: Why Is Unsalted Butter Used In Recipes - Montalvospirits,"<p>Unsalted butter gives you complete control of the overall flavor of your recipe. This is especially important in certain baked goods where the pure, sweet cream flavor of butter is key (butter cookies or pound cakes). As it pertains to cooking, unsalted butter lets the real, natural flavor of your foods come through.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_I_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted""></span>What happens if I use salted butter instead of unsalted?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When you use salted butter in place of unsalted butter, you don’t know how much salt you are adding to your bake. Cook’s Illustrated notes that the amount of salt present in butter can further vary depending on the brand. Besides, salt isn’t all you have to worry about.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_recipes_call_for_unsalted_butter_instead_of_salted_butter""></span>Why do recipes call for unsalted butter instead of salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When a recipe calls for unsalted butter, that means that the salt levels in the recipe account for no other salt source.  Also, salt is a preservative. Salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter. That means that unsalted butter is typically fresher.</p>
<p></p><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""500"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jiZ6pIDB5pg"" width=""700""></iframe></noscript>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted_in_a_pound_cake""></span>What happens if you use salted butter instead of unsalted in a pound cake?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>All other factors being equal, using salted butter instead of unsalted butter in a recipe will result in a baked good containing more salt. If you want or need to use salted butter in place of unsalted butter — and the recipe calls for adding salt — omit the salt or use less salt than is called for in the recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_recipes_have_unsalted_butter""></span>Why do recipes have unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It gives the baker total control over the salt content and resulting flavour of the finished product. Using unsalted butter is also more convenient, as the cook doesn’t have to adjust the salt content of the recipe depending on the saltiness of the butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_use_salted_butter_for_baking_cookies""></span>Can you use salted butter for baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Technically, yes. You can use salted butter instead of unsalted butter if that’s all you’ve got, especially if you’re making something simple like cookies where the chemistry of adding salt in a specific amount and at a certain time won’t terribly affect the outcome, unlike bread.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_use_salted_butter_for_baking_cakes""></span>Can you use salted butter for baking cakes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The simple answer is that yes, it is fine to use salted butter in baking.  But recipes tend to specify a small amount of salt in their ingredients and this is where salted butter falls short: you can’t control the amount of salt that is in the butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_butter_do_chefs_use""></span>What butter do chefs use?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It has a higher butterfat content than American butter—82% vs 80%. The amount of difference sounds small but it is believed to be enough to account for the difference in flavor and texture. More fat, more flavor. That’s why so many chefs rely on European butter to bring out the best in their dishes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_salted_and_unsalted_butter_make_a_difference_in_baking""></span>Does salted and unsalted butter make a difference in baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It would take quite a lot of salted butter to really produce a huge taste difference in baked goods, but it’s still good to be able to fully control the amount of salt. 2. Unsalted butter is fresher. Salt is a preservative and therefore, salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_margarine_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>Can I use margarine instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>You can use margarine as a substitute for unsalted butter. Use exactly the same amount of margarine as you would butter, just be careful as margarine is more watery than butter so you might need to reduce the amount of liquid added to your recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_I_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted_butter_in_banana_bread""></span>What happens if I use salted butter instead of unsalted butter in banana bread?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Using salted butter in banana bread makes it heavier. In contrast, the use of unsalted butter makes the bread lighter. Bread made up of salted butter is less moist and soft as compared to the one made up of unsalted butter.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_do_you_remove_salt_from_salted_butter""></span>How do you remove salt from salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>From a chemistry perspective (not disagreeing with Leta).  Add some water to the butter, say about an equal amount. Heat it up the butter + water until the butter melts. Mix it thoroughly. Let the mixture sit until the water and butter separate. Cool and remove the butter from the top. </p>

<p>Bakers and chefs usually choose unsalted butter in their recipes because it’s easier to manage the salt content in the dish. Most recipes that call for butter—especially baked goods and desserts—are created with unsalted butter. It is the standard in baking and is always implied unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>For cakes, cookies, and pastries, butter (unsalted, that is) provides richer flavor. (It begins as cream, after all, and margarine is made from vegetable oil.) Butter’s high fat content is also what gives baked goods their texture.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_you_cook_steak_with_salted_or_unsalted_butter""></span>Do you cook steak with salted or unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>While preparing the steak butter, you must be aware of the salt quantity. We recommend using unsalted butter so you can adjust the salt amount according to your preferences. By using salted butter, you risk making the mixture too salty.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_margarine_instead_of_butter""></span>Can I use margarine instead of butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When can I use margarine instead of butter?  In baking, melted margarine could work in recipes that call for melted butter, but in recipes that call for softened butter, swapping in tub margarine may change the texture; for example, cakes will be less tender, and cookies will generally spread out more and be less crisp.</p>

<p>Substitutes for Unsalted Butter For 1 cup unsalted butter, substitute 1 cup shortening, ⅞ cup (that’s 14 Tbsp. or ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp.) vegetable oil, or ⅞ cup lard.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-is-baking-soda-used-in-recipes/,Why Is Baking Soda Used In Recipes - Montalvospirits,"<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent used in baked goods like cakes, muffins, and cookies.  Baking soda becomes activated when it’s combined with both an acidic ingredient and a liquid. Upon activation, carbon dioxide is produced, which allows baked goods to rise and become light and fluffy (1).</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_recipes_use_baking_powder_and_baking_soda""></span>Why do recipes use baking powder and baking soda?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Both baking powder and baking soda are chemical leavening agents that cause batters to rise when baked.  When a recipe contains baking powder and baking soda, the baking powder does most of the leavening. The baking soda is added to neutralize the acids in the recipe plus to add tenderness and some leavening.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_dont_use_baking_soda_in_a_recipe""></span>What happens if you don’t use baking soda in a recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Leaving baking soda out of the cake prevents it from rising, but you can use baking powder as a substitute. Baking soda is a salt that makes food light and fluffy. If you don’t have this ingredient at hand, use a baking soda substitute. Without it, your cake won’t rise and can turn out flat.</p>
<p></p><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""500"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyt5hUdL6QY"" width=""700""></iframe></noscript>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_I_use_baking_soda_or_baking_powder_for_cookies""></span>Should I use baking soda or baking powder for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Baking soda is generally about three times stronger than baking powder, so adjust your recipe accordingly. Baking soda and baking powder can produce cookies with different textures. Baking soda is typically used for chewy cookies, while baking powder is generally used for light and airy cookies.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_baking_soda_a_good_substitute_for_baking_powder""></span>Is baking soda a good substitute for baking powder?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If you have a baking recipe that calls for baking soda, and you only have baking powder, you may be able to substitute, but you will need 2 or 3 times as much baking powder for the same amount of baking soda to get the same amount of leavening power, and you may end up with something that’s a little bitter tasting,.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_baking_soda_necessary_for_cookies""></span>Is baking soda necessary for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When making cookies without baking soda, it is important to keep in mind the type of cookie you are making and the kinds of ingredients that the recipe calls for. Cookies that rely heavily on acidic ingredients will not be the best to substitute baking soda, as it may produce varied results.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_baking_soda_necessary_in_banana_bread""></span>Is baking soda necessary in banana bread?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Baking soda works best in conjunction with an acidic ingredient. In the case of banana bread, this may be buttermilk, brown sugar, molasses or the bananas themselves. Recipes generally include just enough baking soda to balance the acidity in the batter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_forget_to_put_baking_soda_in_cookies""></span>What happens if you forget to put baking soda in cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>baking soda allows the ingredients to rise and become airy. Without baking soda, your cookies will be very dense, perhaps not chewy, and not as tasty.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_did_my_cookies_turn_out_like_cake""></span>Why did my cookies turn out like cake?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If your cookies come out flat on top, with a cake-like texture, you’ve added too many eggs.  Saving cookies from too many eggs isn’t as straightforward as saving it from too much or too little flour. It takes a little finagling. Add some flour and maybe a little bit more sugar.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_makes_a_chewy_cookie""></span>What makes a chewy cookie?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>What’s in a Chewy Cookie? Well, the long and short answer to chewy cookies is it’s all about the moisture content. Cookies that are dense and chewy incorporate more moisture into the batter. This can be achieved by making substitutions with ingredients, or even just changing the way you incorporate certain ingredients.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_makes_cookies_chewy_or_crispy""></span>What makes cookies chewy or crispy?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Using lower-moisture sugar (granulated) and fat (vegetable shortening), plus a longer, slower bake than normal, produces light, crunchy cookies. That said, using a combination of butter and vegetable shortening (as in the original recipe), or even using all butter, will make an acceptably crunchy chocolate chip cookie.</p>

<p>Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate, with nothing else in that box. In order for it to produce the gas, it needs an acid added.  Baking powder is a combination of sodium bicarbonate and powdered acid (like cream of tartar). Because it already contains an acid, all it needs is moisture and heat added to activate it.</p>

<p>If baking soda is added instead of baking powder, try the addition of an acid to the mixture. Lemon juice, orange juice, passion fruit juice are all acidic. Also is yogurt from milk. Add something citrus like lemon juice.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_sub_baking_soda_for_baking_powder_in_cookies""></span>Can you sub baking soda for baking powder in cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Can I substitute baking soda for baking powder? Yes, as long as there is enough of an acidic ingredient to make a reaction (for 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, you need 1 cup of buttermilk or yogurt or 1 teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar).</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_I_dont_use_baking_soda_in_banana_bread""></span>What happens if I don’t use baking soda in banana bread?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>What happens if you don’t put baking soda in banana bread? Baking soda is a leavening agent that causes the dough to double in size and gives it a soft and fluffy texture. When you omit it from your banana bread recipe, you end up with dense bread.</p>

<p>Almost all pancake recipes uses baking powder or baking soda. However we can also make regular pancakes using all purpose flour or wheat flour pancakes without baking powder or baking soda as well following this easy pancake recipe at home.  This is not a dairy free recipe since we use whole milk in the preparation.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_substitute_psyllium_husk_for_flour""></span>Can you substitute psyllium husk for flour?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>I have found that psyllium cannot be used as a substitute for all-purpose flour on its own. It is quite different from regular flour and cannot act the same way in baking. Because it does not make a good substitute alone, you will need to combine it with another gluten-free flour to create light and fluffy bread.</p>

<p>Coconut flour or almond flour Almond flour is also gluten-free and high in protein, making it a versatile ingredient for all sorts of recipes and a strong psyllium husk powder substitute.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_xanthan_gum_be_substituted_for_psyllium_husk""></span>Can xanthan gum be substituted for psyllium husk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When baking, substitute every 1 part of xanthan gum with 2 parts of psyllium husk. Like xanthan gum, psyllium husk is a soluble fiber — a non-digestible starch that forms a gel-like substance in your gut. In recipes that call for xanthan gum, you’ll need to use twice as much psyllium husk.</p>

<p>Cornstarch is one of the easiest swaps for psyllium husk since most households probably already have it in their cupboards. If you’re using cornstarch instead of psyllium in baking and other recipes, use twice as much cornstarch as you would psyllium husk.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-is-unsalted-butter-used-in-some-baking-recipes/,Why Is Unsalted Butter Used In Some Baking Recipes - Montalvospirits,"<p>Unsalted butter gives you complete control of the overall flavor of your recipe. This is especially important in certain baked goods where the pure, sweet cream flavor of butter is key (butter cookies or pound cakes). As it pertains to cooking, unsalted butter lets the real, natural flavor of your foods come through.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>What happens if you use salted butter instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It would take quite a lot of salted butter to really produce a huge taste difference in baked goods, but it’s still good to be able to fully control the amount of salt. 2. Unsalted butter is fresher. Salt is a preservative and therefore, salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_so_many_recipes_call_for_unsalted_butter""></span>Why do so many recipes call for unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Here’s why: Most importantly: unsalted butter ensures that you can control the amount of salt you add to your cakes, cookies and Fig and Almond Breakfast Cake.  When a recipe calls for unsalted butter, that means that the salt levels in the recipe account for no other salt source.</p>

<p>All other factors being equal, using salted butter instead of unsalted butter in a recipe will result in a baked good containing more salt. If you want or need to use salted butter in place of unsalted butter — and the recipe calls for adding salt — omit the salt or use less salt than is called for in the recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_it_OK_to_use_salted_butter_when_recipe_calls_for_unsalted""></span>Is it OK to use salted butter when recipe calls for unsalted?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Both salted butter and unsalted butter can be used interchangeably in any recipe, but if the recipe calls specifically for unsalted butter, it’s probably because the recipe has been tested with it and it’s the preferred butter for that particular recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Whats_the_best_butter_for_baking_cakes""></span>What’s the best butter for baking cakes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>For baking purposes, the Test Kitchen recommends using unsalted butter so you can better control the amount of salt that goes into the recipe. Salted butter is best for serving at the table with bread or to flavor a dish, like mashed potatoes.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_use_unsalted_butter_for_cookies""></span>Can you use unsalted butter for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Whenever you are baking cookies, you should always opt for unsalted butter, as it is fresher and makes it easier to control salt use in recipes that are meant to be sweet.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_butter_do_chefs_use""></span>What butter do chefs use?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It has a higher butterfat content than American butter—82% vs 80%. The amount of difference sounds small but it is believed to be enough to account for the difference in flavor and texture. More fat, more flavor. That’s why so many chefs rely on European butter to bring out the best in their dishes.</p>

<p>Is Salted Butter Better Than Unsalted? Now, if you’re wondering if one butter is better than the other, the answer is no. Both salted and unsalted versions are useful in cooking and baking. They are both equally delicious and make for rich, delectable recipes.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_do_you_remove_salt_from_salted_butter""></span>How do you remove salt from salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>From a chemistry perspective (not disagreeing with Leta).  Add some water to the butter, say about an equal amount. Heat it up the butter + water until the butter melts. Mix it thoroughly. Let the mixture sit until the water and butter separate. Cool and remove the butter from the top. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_use_unsalted_butter_in_sugar_cookies""></span>Why use unsalted butter in sugar cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>By using unsalted butter, you control the amount of salt in your cookies. If you only have salted butter, just reduce the salt to a tiny pinch or 1/8 teaspoon.  You’ll want to beat the butter and sugar together for 1 to 2 minutes until they’re well combined before adding the rest of the ingredients.</p>

<p>Using salted butter in banana bread makes it heavier. In contrast, the use of unsalted butter makes the bread lighter. Bread made up of salted butter is less moist and soft as compared to the one made up of unsalted butter.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_butter_need_to_be_refrigerated""></span>Does butter need to be refrigerated?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Unsalted Butter This rule is simple. If you prefer unsalted butter, refrigerate it. Same goes for whipped butter. If it creeps above 70 degrees Fahrenheit in your kitchen, all butter should go into the fridge to avoid going bad — even into the freezer if you want to store it for a few months.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_margarine_instead_of_butter""></span>Can I use margarine instead of butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When can I use margarine instead of butter?  In baking, melted margarine could work in recipes that call for melted butter, but in recipes that call for softened butter, swapping in tub margarine may change the texture; for example, cakes will be less tender, and cookies will generally spread out more and be less crisp.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_the_brand_of_butter_make_a_difference_in_baking""></span>Does the brand of butter make a difference in baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>In baking, the flavor differences mostly disappear. High-fat butters can be used in traditional recipes. “You shouldn’t see much difference,” said Kim Anderson, director of the Pillsbury test kitchen, “maybe a slightly richer flavor and more tender crumb.” Most important is that butter be well preserved.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_it_better_to_use_margarine_or_butter_in_cakes""></span>Is it better to use margarine or butter in cakes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>For cakes, cookies, and pastries, butter (unsalted, that is) provides richer flavor.  Margarine, which can contain more water and less fat, may make thin cookies that spread out while baking (and may burn). Butter is also the better choice for frying.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_you_use_unsalted_butter_for_baking""></span>Should you use unsalted butter for baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Bakers and chefs usually choose unsalted butter in their recipes because it’s easier to manage the salt content in the dish. Most recipes that call for butter—especially baked goods and desserts—are created with unsalted butter. It is the standard in baking and is always implied unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Which_butter_is_best_for_baking_cookies""></span>Which butter is best for baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>unsalted butter is generally preferred by bakers. By doing this, they can control the amount of salt in their baked goods. Butter that is unsalted is typically more fresh as well, since salt is a preservative and butter that is salted has a longer shelf life.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_margarine_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>Can I use margarine instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>You can use margarine as a substitute for unsalted butter. Use exactly the same amount of margarine as you would butter, just be careful as margarine is more watery than butter so you might need to reduce the amount of liquid added to your recipe.</p>

<p>From flavor, consistency, economic implications, and consumer satisfaction, the food item needs to be produced exactly the same, every single time. For this to be possible, a recipe must be converted to a formula, which then needs to be commercialized, or tested and approved in a manufacturing setting.</p>

<p>It is important to read the whole recipe before you begin cooking. This helps you know how the dish is made. All recipes start with the name of the dish. Next will come the ingredients needed.</p>

<p>To do this:  Place a container on the scale and zero out (tare) the scale to adjust for the weight of the container. Measure the amount of the ingredient, as noted in the original recipe, into container and record the weight. Repeat the measuring and weighing process with all ingredients. </p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_difference_between_recipe_and_standardized_recipe""></span>What is the difference between recipe and standardized recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Some recipes have missing ingredients, faulty seasonings, insufficient or poor instructions causing more work, and some are simply not tested. A standardized recipe is a set of written instructions used to consistently prepare a known quantity and quality of food for a specific location.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_different_about_the_professional_recipe_vs_the_home_recipe""></span>What is different about the professional recipe vs the home recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>How much does 1 cup​ cost? What is the major difference between a professional recipe and​ home-based recipe? Culinary jargon or culinary shorthand in a professional recipe versus clear concise and specific instructions for the home cook version. Standardized recipes help ensure which of the​ following?.</p>

<p>Here in the food writing world, many of us follow an informal standard that you need to make at least three changes before you can claim credit for a recipe. Those changes need to be more substantial than changing 1/2 teaspoon salt to 1/4 teaspoon, although the changes don’t have to just be in the ingredients.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_there_a_need_to_substitute_ingredients""></span>Why is there a need to substitute ingredients?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Each ingredient in a recipe has a specific function. Substitution of one ingredient for another may alter the taste, color, moisture content or texture of the product. For this reason, it is suggested that ingredient substitution be used in unexpected situations only.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_does_scaling_a_recipe_mean""></span>What does scaling a recipe mean?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When cooking and baking, we may find it necessary to increase or decrease the yield (the amount of what we are making) of a recipe.  Increasing or decreasing the yield is called “scaling” a recipe. We can do it by multiplying and dividing each ingredient by a scaling factor.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_all_recipes_be_scaled_up_or_down""></span>Can all recipes be scaled up or down?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re increasing a recipe or decreasing it — the procedure for adjusting the ingredient quantities for a different number of portions is the same. We call this scaling a recipe.</p>

<p>Water is a common ingredient, but since many people use the timer on their bread machines, most recipes call for non-fat dry milk or powdered buttermilk. However, if you are mixing your dough right away, you can certainly use fresh milk. Simply replace the water with milk or buttermilk and omit the powdered milk.</p>

<p>Milk (or milk powder) is a way of enhancing the dough to: Make a softer loaf (due to the milkfat acting as a tenderizer by interfering with gluten production) Add flavor to the loaf. Enhance browning of the crust due to the potential carmelization of the milk sugars.</p>

<p>Milk is a great source of lactose and protein, both things that can do a world of good for baked goods, particularly fat-rising items like doughnuts. The milk powder adds flavor to the mixture, for sure. But it can also contribute to a darker golden crust and a more tender innards.</p>

<p>Dry milk is added to baked goods to make the bread more flavorful and tender, according to “Cookwise.” For recipes, if you do not have milk powder, you can substitute liquid milk, but other adjustments to the recipe must be made.</p>

<p>Option #1: Omit the dry milk powder (and use water) Typically recipes that call for dry milk powder use water as the liquid in the dough. If you simply leave out the dry milk powder, your loaf may be slightly less tender and a bit more pale than it otherwise would be.</p>

<p>Milk changes bread recipes by producing a softer loaf, due to the milk fat content, which also gives bread a richer flavor. Bread made with milk browns more easily than bread made with water, as lactose or milk sugar will caramelize as it bakes.</p>

<p>Milk is used to add flavor. It enriches the dough and gives the bread a creamy color, soft crumb and a golden crust.</p>

<p>1 Tablespoon is 1/4 cup milk instead of water. I have done this as a replacement for dried milk in bread many times with success. Yep; note that dried milk is normally non-fat, so if you want a perfectly accurate substitution, use skim milk.</p>

<p>One of the important uses of dry milk I value the most is its addition to bread dough.  Their dry milk not only adds a smoother and more mellow flavor, it also results in a more tender texture and a significantly higher rise.</p>

<p>Important note: This is not instant dry milk which is not high heat treated and it is not intended for table use. The taste is a little different and it will not dissolve as readily in water. It dissolves in the bread as you knead the dough. We add this or dry buttermilk to most of our bread mixes.</p>

<p>Yes, you can use milk instead of water but you need to adjust the recipe to account for the fact that milk is about 89% water. So for every 100g of water in the original recipe, use 112g of milk and you’re good to go.</p>

<p>The recommended amount of skim milk powder used in fermented dough is 2% to 8% based on flour, and up 15% in cakes. Buttermilk and sour milk are used to make variety breads. They have a lower pH and require a shorter fermentation for good results.</p>

<p>Powdered milk never tastes quite the same as fresh milk, but there are ways to improve the taste.  You can also try to restore the fats that give milk a richer, smoother mouth feel, but it’s often easier to improve the taste with sugar or other additions instead.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_do_you_make_a_cup_of_powdered_milk""></span>How do you make a cup of powdered milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>For 1 cup of water, use ¼ cup of milk powder. To get your desired amount of milk, simply multiply the number of cups by ¼. A test tip for making large quantities of milk, mix half the water with the full amount of milk powder, then add the rest of the water to fill up.</p>

<p>In the UK its only available in powder form, is most commonly known as a coffee whitener and is available as either “regular” or “light”.  In the United States, using a milk substitute for coffee and tea is a lot more popular and as a result, there are a lot more Coffee-Mate options to choose from.</p>
