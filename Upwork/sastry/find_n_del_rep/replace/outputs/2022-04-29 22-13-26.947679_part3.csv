<p>It would take quite a lot of salted butter to really produce a huge taste difference in baked goods, but it’s still good to be able to fully control the amount of salt. 2. Unsalted butter is fresher. Salt is a preservative and therefore, salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter.</p>

<p>Both salted butter and unsalted butter can be used interchangeably in any recipe, but if the recipe calls specifically for unsalted butter, it’s probably because the recipe has been tested with it and it’s the preferred butter for that particular recipe.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_make_cookies_with_salted_butter""></span>What happens if you make cookies with salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Technically, yes. You can use salted butter instead of unsalted butter if that’s all you’ve got, especially if you’re making something simple like cookies where the chemistry of adding salt in a specific amount and at a certain time won’t terribly affect the outcome, unlike bread. The problem is in control.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_some_recipes_call_for_unsalted_butter_instead_of_salted""></span>Why do some recipes call for unsalted butter instead of salted?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When a recipe calls for unsalted butter, that means that the salt levels in the recipe account for no other salt source.  Also, salt is a preservative. Salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter. That means that unsalted butter is typically fresher.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_do_you_remove_salt_from_salted_butter""></span>How do you remove salt from salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>From a chemistry perspective (not disagreeing with Leta).  Add some water to the butter, say about an equal amount. Heat it up the butter + water until the butter melts. Mix it thoroughly. Let the mixture sit until the water and butter separate. Cool and remove the butter from the top. </p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_bake_cookies_with_unsalted_butter""></span>Can you bake cookies with unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Bottom line: All the cookies worked, but it’s best to use unsalted butter if the recipe calls for it—and maybe even if it doesn’t.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_are_my_cookies_flat""></span>Why are my cookies flat?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If your ratios of flour, butter and sugar off, the cookie might spread too testly.  Sugar sucks up liquid, and when those cookies bake, it’ll release the liquid and cause the cookies to spread out. If you use too much butter, the cookies will end up flat and greasy.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_margarine_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>Can I use margarine instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>You can use margarine as a substitute for unsalted butter. Use exactly the same amount of margarine as you would butter, just be careful as margarine is more watery than butter so you might need to reduce the amount of liquid added to your recipe.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_substitute_unsalted_butter_for_regular_butter""></span>Can you substitute unsalted butter for regular butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>However, sometimes a recipe calls for salted butter, but all you have is unsalted butter.  But if you only have unsalted butter when the recipe calls for regular butter, you can add a ¼ teaspoon of salt for every stick or ½ cup of Challenge Unsalted Butter required.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_can_I_use_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>What can I use instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Substitutes for Unsalted Butter For 1 cup unsalted butter, substitute 1 cup shortening, ⅞ cup (that’s 14 Tbsp. or ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp.) vegetable oil, or ⅞ cup lard.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""When_a_recipe_calls_for_butter_is_it_salted_or_unsalted""></span>When a recipe calls for butter is it salted or unsalted?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>To be able to tell, look at the amount of salt in the recipe. Usually in a baking recipe the most salt you’ll see is 1/4-½ teaspoon per ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter. If there is a lot more than that, be sure to use unsalted. If there is less, use salted.</p>

<p>It has a higher butterfat content than American butter—82% vs 80%. The amount of difference sounds small but it is believed to be enough to account for the difference in flavor and texture. More fat, more flavor. That’s why so many chefs rely on European butter to bring out the best in their dishes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_it_matter_if_you_use_salted_butter_in_baking""></span>Does it matter if you use salted butter in baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The simple answer is that yes, it is fine to use salted butter in baking. That being said, there is a reason that bakers – myself included – and just about all other cooks use unsalted butter as their kitchen staple instead of salted. Salt serves two roles in butter, acting as a preservative and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Which_butter_brand_is_best_for_baking""></span>Which butter brand is best for baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>  Best butters for baking. Land O’Lakes Unsalted Butter. Best butter for spreading. Organic Valley Salted Butter. Best grass-fed butters. Kerrygold. Best organic butter. Horizon Organic. Best imported butters. Lurpak Slightly Salted Butter. Best specialty butters. Fourth and Heart Ghee. Best vegan butter. </p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Which_butter_is_best_for_baking_cookies""></span>Which butter is best for baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>unsalted butter is generally preferred by bakers. By doing this, they can control the amount of salt in their baked goods. Butter that is unsalted is typically more fresh as well, since salt is a preservative and butter that is salted has a longer shelf life.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_add_an_extra_egg_to_cookies""></span>What happens if you add an extra egg to cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The protein in the yolk heats up and turns into a “gel-like substance,” which allows for a super soft texture once fully baked. The more eggs you add, the more chewy and almost cake-like your cookie will be.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_makes_a_chewy_cookie""></span>What makes a chewy cookie?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>What’s in a Chewy Cookie? Well, the long and short answer to chewy cookies is it’s all about the moisture content. Cookies that are dense and chewy incorporate more moisture into the batter. This can be achieved by making substitutions with ingredients, or even just changing the way you incorporate certain ingredients.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_I_use_butter_or_margarine_in_cookies""></span>Should I use butter or margarine in cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>But when you’re baking, butter triumphs over margarine every time. For cakes, cookies, and pastries, butter (unsalted, that is) provides richer flavor.  Margarine, which can contain more water and less fat, may make thin cookies that spread out while baking (and may burn). Butter is also the better choice for frying.</p>

<p>Technically, yes. You can use salted butter instead of unsalted butter if that’s all you’ve got, especially if you’re making something simple like cookies where the chemistry of adding salt in a specific amount and at a certain time won’t terribly affect the outcome, unlike bread.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_unsalted_butter_taste_different""></span>Does unsalted butter taste different?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Think of it as butter in its purest form. As a result, unsalted butter has a shorter shelf life than salted butter (and many cooks will also tell you that it has a fresher taste). In terms of flavor, unsalted butter has a more pronounced mellow sweetness than salted butter.</p>

<p>When you use salted butter in place of unsalted butter, you don’t know how much salt you are adding to your bake. Cook’s Illustrated notes that the amount of salt present in butter can further vary depending on the brand. Besides, salt isn’t all you have to worry about.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_it_OK_to_use_salted_butter_when_recipe_calls_for_unsalted""></span>Is it OK to use salted butter when recipe calls for unsalted?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Both salted butter and unsalted butter can be used interchangeably in any recipe, but if the recipe calls specifically for unsalted butter, it’s probably because the recipe has been tested with it and it’s the preferred butter for that particular recipe.</p>
<p></p><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""500"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/asLxQ0q2Z3w"" width=""700""></iframe></noscript>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_if_my_recipe_calls_for_unsalted_butter""></span>What if my recipe calls for unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Basically, that means if your recipe calls for unsalted butter and you want to use salted, reduce the amount of salt by ¼ teaspoon. If your recipe calls for salted butter and you’re using unsalted, increase the amount of salt by ¼ teaspoon.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted_in_a_pound_cake""></span>What happens if you use salted butter instead of unsalted in a pound cake?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>All other factors being equal, using salted butter instead of unsalted butter in a recipe will result in a baked good containing more salt. If you want or need to use salted butter in place of unsalted butter — and the recipe calls for adding salt — omit the salt or use less salt than is called for in the recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_regular_butter_instead_of_unsalted""></span>Can I use regular butter instead of unsalted?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Technically, yes. You can use salted butter instead of unsalted butter if that’s all you’ve got, especially if you’re making something simple like cookies where the chemistry of adding salt in a specific amount and at a certain time won’t terribly affect the outcome, unlike bread. The problem is in control.</p>

<p>Using salted butter in banana bread makes it heavier. In contrast, the use of unsalted butter makes the bread lighter. Bread made up of salted butter is less moist and soft as compared to the one made up of unsalted butter.</p>

<p>One question I get asked all the time is whether it is acceptable to use salted butter in baking, since most recipes either don’t specify salted or unsalted, or explicitly recommended unsalted butter. The simple answer is that yes, it is fine to use salted butter in baking.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_butter_do_chefs_use""></span>What butter do chefs use?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It has a higher butterfat content than American butter—82% vs 80%. The amount of difference sounds small but it is believed to be enough to account for the difference in flavor and texture. More fat, more flavor. That’s why so many chefs rely on European butter to bring out the best in their dishes.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_butter_need_to_be_refrigerated""></span>Does butter need to be refrigerated?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Unsalted Butter This rule is simple. If you prefer unsalted butter, refrigerate it. Same goes for whipped butter. If it creeps above 70 degrees Fahrenheit in your kitchen, all butter should go into the fridge to avoid going bad — even into the freezer if you want to store it for a few months.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_difference_between_salted_butter_and_unsalted_butter_in_baking""></span>What is the difference between salted butter and unsalted butter in baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The difference between the two kinds of butter is obviously salt. Unsalted butter is all cream, while the salted variety has some salt added, though the amount varies from brand to brand.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_margarine_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>Can I use margarine instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>You can use margarine as a substitute for unsalted butter. Use exactly the same amount of margarine as you would butter, just be careful as margarine is more watery than butter so you might need to reduce the amount of liquid added to your recipe.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_you_need_unsalted_butter_for_baking""></span>Do you need unsalted butter for baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Bakers and chefs usually choose unsalted butter in their recipes because it’s easier to manage the salt content in the dish. Most recipes that call for butter—especially baked goods and desserts—are created with unsalted butter. It is the standard in baking and is always implied unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_freeze_butter""></span>Can you freeze butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Yes, you can freeze butter – in fact, unsalted butter can last up to five months; salted butter up to nine with proper storage. To keep it tasting as fresh as possible, keep the frozen butter in its original wrapping.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Whats_the_best_butter_for_baking_cakes""></span>What’s the best butter for baking cakes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>For baking purposes, the Test Kitchen recommends using unsalted butter so you can better control the amount of salt that goes into the recipe. Salted butter is best for serving at the table with bread or to flavor a dish, like mashed potatoes.</p>

<p>Anytime a recipe calls for butter you should always use unsalted butter. Using salted butter will result in salty brownies that might not rise well.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_olive_oil_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>Can I use olive oil instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Olive oil. In most recipes, olive oil can be substituted for butter at a 3:4 ratio by volume. For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup (225 grams) of butter, you can replace it with 3/4 cups (180 ml) of olive oil.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_use_unsalted_butter_in_sugar_cookies""></span>Why use unsalted butter in sugar cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>By using unsalted butter, you control the amount of salt in your cookies. If you only have salted butter, just reduce the salt to a tiny pinch or 1/8 teaspoon.  You’ll want to beat the butter and sugar together for 1 to 2 minutes until they’re well combined before adding the rest of the ingredients.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_much_salt_is_in_a_stick_of_salted_butter""></span>How much salt is in a stick of salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Typically, salted butter will have around ⅓-¼ teaspoon of salt for every stick. In order to get your desserts baked just right, it is ideal to use unsalted butter.</p>

<p>It would take quite a lot of salted butter to really produce a huge taste difference in baked goods, but it’s still good to be able to fully control the amount of salt. 2. Unsalted butter is fresher. Salt is a preservative and therefore, salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_use_unsalted_butter_in_cookies""></span>Why use unsalted butter in cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Unsalted butter gives you complete control of the overall flavor of your recipe. This is especially important in certain baked goods where the pure, sweet cream flavor of butter is key (butter cookies or pound cakes). As it pertains to cooking, unsalted butter lets the real, natural flavor of your foods come through.</p>

<p>Cookie recipes often call for unsalted butter, but both unsalted and salted butter are sold in stores.  And yes, you can use salted butter for cookies, but it’s best to decrease or leave out the amount of extra salt the recipe calls for.</p>

<p>When a recipe calls for unsalted butter, that means that the salt levels in the recipe account for no other salt source.  Also, salt is a preservative. Salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter. That means that unsalted butter is typically fresher.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_do_you_remove_salt_from_salted_butter""></span>How do you remove salt from salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>From a chemistry perspective (not disagreeing with Leta).  Add some water to the butter, say about an equal amount. Heat it up the butter + water until the butter melts. Mix it thoroughly. Let the mixture sit until the water and butter separate. Cool and remove the butter from the top. </p>

<p>Bottom line: All the cookies worked, but it’s best to use unsalted butter if the recipe calls for it—and maybe even if it doesn’t.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Which_butter_is_best_for_baking_cookies""></span>Which butter is best for baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_it_better_to_use_salted_or_unsalted_butter""></span>Is it better to use salted or unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Is Salted Butter Better Than Unsalted? Now, if you’re wondering if one butter is better than the other, the answer is no. Both salted and unsalted versions are useful in cooking and baking. They are both equally delicious and make for rich, delectable recipes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_bake_with_salted_butter""></span>What happens if you bake with salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The simple answer is that yes, it is fine to use salted butter in baking.  Salted butter tastes great on toast and in other foods because the salt will bring out not only the butter flavor, but the other flavors of whatever you’re eating.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_are_my_cookies_flat""></span>Why are my cookies flat?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If your ratios of flour, butter and sugar off, the cookie might spread too testly.  Sugar sucks up liquid, and when those cookies bake, it’ll release the liquid and cause the cookies to spread out. If you use too much butter, the cookies will end up flat and greasy.</p>

<p>So, how do you pick between salted or unsalted butter for cookies? Whenever you are baking cookies, you should always opt for unsalted butter, as it is fresher and makes it easier to control salt use in recipes that are meant to be sweet.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_there_a_difference_between_salted_and_unsalted_butter_when_baking""></span>Is there a difference between salted and unsalted butter when baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Since unsalted butter is just churned cream with nothing else added, the flavor of the sweet cream stands out. Salted butter has a saltier taste, which can cloud the taste of your baked goods. When you want to have complete control over the flavor in your recipe, you want to use unsalted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_butter_do_chefs_use""></span>What butter do chefs use?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It has a higher butterfat content than American butter—82% vs 80%. The amount of difference sounds small but it is believed to be enough to account for the difference in flavor and texture. More fat, more flavor. That’s why so many chefs rely on European butter to bring out the best in their dishes.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_chefs_use_salted_or_unsalted_butter""></span>Do chefs use salted or unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>As you might have guessed, salted contains salt while unsalted does not. According to Chef Eddy Van Damme, controlling the amount of salt in a recipe is extremely important to the outcome, so bakers and pastry chefs do not use salted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_much_salt_do_I_add_to_2_tablespoons_of_unsalted_butter""></span>How much salt do I add to 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>That is why it’s best to use unsalted butter in baking so you can control the amount of salt and the recipe comes out precise every time. But if you only have unsalted butter and the recipe calls for salted, the general rule is to add 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_the_brand_of_butter_make_a_difference_in_baking""></span>Does the brand of butter make a difference in baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>In baking, the flavor differences mostly disappear. High-fat butters can be used in traditional recipes. “You shouldn’t see much difference,” said Kim Anderson, director of the Pillsbury test kitchen, “maybe a slightly richer flavor and more tender crumb.” Most important is that butter be well preserved.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_brown_butter_better_for_cookies""></span>Why is brown butter better for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Browning the butter gives the cookies a more intensely nutty, butterscotch flavor. Chopping the chocolate by hand creates large and small pieces for more textural and flavor contrast.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-do-online-recipes-have-stories/,Quick Answer: Why Do Online Recipes Have Stories - Montalvospirits,"<p>People create blogs because they want to write, not because they want to share recipes. The recipes are only there to give them something to write about, as simply relating a recipe is not actually writing. For the people who write them, the stories are the point. They are not needless; they are the reason they write.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_there_a_story_before_recipes""></span>Why is there a story before recipes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It’s true that many (if not most) food bloggers write long narratives preceding their recipes. Sometimes, they explain how they developed the recipe.  They might share a story about the dish providing them comfort in a difficult time, or how cooking the dish with a loved one healed a broken relationship.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_recipes_have_stories_copyright""></span>Why do recipes have stories copyright?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Recipes can be protected under copyright law if they are accompanied by “substantial literary expression.” This expression can be an explanation or detailed directions, which is likely why food and recipe bloggers often share stories and personal anecdotes alongside a recipe’s ingredients.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_recipe_websites_have_so_many_ads""></span>Why do recipe websites have so many ads?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>They need ads all over their content so that they can earn more money from each user that visits the recipe. They need popups to capture your email address so that they can send you future articles or offer you products to purchase.</p>

<p>And Google’s search engine algorithm penalizes sites whose content duplicates other sites while rewarding sites with original content and a trusted brand name. So the competition in recipes is to either be a beloved site with short blurbs, or be a less reputable site with longer ones.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_are_blogs_so_long""></span>Why are blogs so long?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>But in terms of why it is so popular for bloggers to write long-form content you can really trace it back to two main reasons: Google’s search engine guidelines and advice from popular blogs. Google has long been spouting the idea that useful content was key to better rankings.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_food_bloggers_steal_recipes""></span>Do food bloggers steal recipes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Many notable cookbook authors say yes.  Others have seen their recipes copied by bloggers, fellow cookbook authors, and even food magazines without credit. Some say that they have had their recipes “borrowed” by someone who gained a lot of money from doing so.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_it_illegal_to_steal_a_recipe""></span>Is it illegal to steal a recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Recipes can usually be copyrighted, but that generally only provides protection from copies of the exact written recipe. A competitor substantially changing a written recipe or just using it without writing down an exact copy may not be in violation of the copyright, Duffy said.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_post_other_peoples_recipes_on_your_blog""></span>Can you post other people’s recipes on your blog?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The question that frequently comes up is what to do if you can use someone else’s recipe on your website or blog? The answer is that you cannot cut and paste content directly from one website onto another (yours) unless you have their permission.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_are_recipe_sites_so_long_winded""></span>Why are recipe sites so long winded?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Food bloggers use long-form content because it improves their search engine optimization (SEO).</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_the_recipe_at_the_bottom""></span>Why is the recipe at the bottom?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Having the recipe at the bottom underneath the rest of the content does a few things: It earns the blogger more money, since people need to scroll to the bottom and see the ads. It helps users stay on the page for more time, which can help with SEO, among other things.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-did-kfc-change-their-recipe/,Why Did Kfc Change Their Recipe - Montalvospirits,"<p>To revive consumer interest in its fried chicken, KFC is going back to cooking it the way the original Colonel Sanders did, with a guarantee to customers that if they don’t like the taste, they can get a fresh batch.  ‘ Our customers were saying ‘Your food doesn’t taste the same as it used to.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_KFC_still_use_the_original_recipe""></span>Does KFC still use the original recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>In 1983, William Poundstone conducted laboratory research into the coating mix, as described in his book Big Secrets, and claimed that a sample he examined contained only flour, salt, monosodium glutamate and black pepper. KFC maintains that it still adheres to Sanders’ original 1940 recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_does_KFC_not_taste_the_same""></span>Why does KFC not taste the same?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Technically, yes. Originally, part of the secret was to cook chicken parts that where cut in similar size pieces. Some old timers will swear that “KFC” chicken does not taste the same as the “Kentucky Fried Chicken” served decades ago. The company states they still use the “eleven herbs and spices”.</p>

<p>Kentucky Fried Chicken rebranded to KFC instead.  That said, in November 2016, KFC and the State of Kentucky settled over the use of the trademarked word “Kentucky,” with the chain then announcing they would resume their old name. Now, read about the secret that makes KFC’s fried chicken so crispy.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_KFC_Original_not_crispy""></span>Why is KFC Original not crispy?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>KFC offer original and extra crispy chicken because people like to have options. Really, the difference between the two is just more breading on the extra crispy, which costs them pennies.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_KFC_chicken_so_moist""></span>Why is KFC chicken so moist?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The chicken is amazingly moist — thanks to a special device. The pressure fryer not only lets KFC cook chicken faster and with less oil, but it also locks in moisture. Witherly theorizes that it may also drive some of that salt and MSG into the meat, making it that much more delicious.</p>

<p>Food coloring. When people started to complain about food coloring and chemicals in food overall, KFC decided to get rid of the coloring and went with the more natural look. And that’s how it’s been ever since. That neon green was an artificial colour.</p>

<p>KFC wasn’t always called PFK in Quebec Though it had already done business in Canada for 24 years, KFC had no choice but to go by PFK in Quebec as well as update the language of the menus and ensure all their Quebec employees spoke to their customers in French.  This means that PFK can technically go by KFC now.</p>

<p>Originally Answered: How often does KFC change their frying oil?

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_milk_instead_of_milk_powder_in_bread""></span>Can I use milk instead of milk powder in bread?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Dry milk is added to baked goods to make the bread more flavorful and tender, according to “Cookwise.” For recipes, if you do not have milk powder, you can substitute liquid milk, but other adjustments to the recipe must be made.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_use_powdered_milk_in_recipes""></span>Why use powdered milk in recipes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Milk is a great source of lactose and protein, both things that can do a world of good for baked goods, particularly fat-rising items like doughnuts. The milk powder adds flavor to the mixture, for sure. But it can also contribute to a darker golden crust and a more tender innards.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_omit_dry_milk""></span>Can I omit dry milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Option #1: Omit the dry milk powder (and use water) Typically recipes that call for dry milk powder use water as the liquid in the dough. If you simply leave out the dry milk powder, your loaf may be slightly less tender and a bit more pale than it otherwise would be.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_there_a_substitute_for_dry_milk_powder""></span>Is there a substitute for dry milk powder?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When looking for a milk powder substitute there are many options. You can use evaporated milk, condensed milk, malted milk powder, sweetened condensed milk, almond milk powder, buttermilk powder, skimmed milk, and skimmed milk powder to name a few additional options.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_it_better_to_make_bread_with_milk_or_water""></span>Is it better to make bread with milk or water?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Milk changes bread recipes by producing a softer loaf, due to the milk fat content, which also gives bread a richer flavor. Bread made with milk browns more easily than bread made with water, as lactose or milk sugar will caramelize as it bakes.</p>

<p>Substituting milk for water in bread will usually add both fat (from milkfat) and sugar (lactose). Several changes can happen, including: The crust will typically be softer. The crust will brown more testly (due to sugar) and can darken more evenly before burning.</p>

<p>Yes, you can use milk instead of water but you need to adjust the recipe to account for the fact that milk is about 89% water. So for every 100g of water in the original recipe, use 112g of milk and you’re good to go.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_bread_improver_substitute""></span>What is bread improver substitute?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Bread improver is an unflavoured acidic substance. You can substitute with citric acid, vinegar or even orange juice for bread improver. The vitamin C in orange juice helps the gluten form. You can replace the water with an equal amount of fresh orange juice for a lighter rise and texture.</p>

<p>Powdered milk can easily replace fresh milk Keeping dry milk powder in your pantry ensures that you’ll always have milk on hand for baking. When it comes to baking breads, dry milk powder can be used in place of the milk called for in the recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_powdered_milk_real_milk""></span>Is powdered milk real milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>

<p>Powdered milk never tastes quite the same as fresh milk, but there are ways to improve the taste.  You can also try to restore the fats that give milk a richer, smoother mouth feel, but it’s often easier to improve the taste with sugar or other additions instead.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_does_milk_affect_bread_dough""></span>How does milk affect bread dough?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Milk is used to add flavor. It enriches the dough and gives the bread a creamy color, soft crumb and a golden crust.  Just like water, milk used in bread recipes, especially when mixed directly with yeast must be lukewarm.</p>

<p>Evaporated milk is basically condensed milk minus the sugar.  Dry milk a.k.a. milk powder is whole or nonfat milk with the water removed; dry buttermilk is made the same way. Reconstituted with water, dry milk is a cheap alternative to regular fluid milk.</p>

<p>Is Powdered Milk Bad For You? Powdered milk is nutritionally equivalent to fresh milk and is relatively non-perishable. It can be added to recipes to increase the protein content and nutritional value. Whole milk powder is likely to contain oxidized cholesterol, which may damage blood vessels and promote heart disease.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-do-recipes-call-for-scalded-milk/,Quick Answer: Why Do Recipes Call For Scalded Milk - Montalvospirits,"<p>Scalding the milk denatures whey proteins. This makes the milk a better food for yeast, which means faster proofing, larger volume, and a fluffier product. It also makes for a smoother dough with better moisture retention. So the next time a recipe asks you to scald milk, just do it.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_purpose_of_scalded_milk_in_a_recipe""></span>What is the purpose of scalded milk in a recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Today, most milk is pasteurized, so the bacteria and enzyme are already gone. Also, scalding milk raises the temperature, which helps dissolve yeast and melt butter when added to bread recipes. Sauteing is when you cook foods testly over pretty high heat.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_regular_milk_instead_of_scalded_milk""></span>Can I use regular milk instead of scalded milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>There is no substitute for scalded milk. You can simply use regular milk (not scalded) in your recipe. However, the milk should at least be at room temperature to not inhibit the yeast from activating properly.</p>

<p>The whey protein in milk can weaken gluten and prevent the dough from rising properly. Scalding the milk deactivates the protein so this doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>However, today (most) milk is pasteurized and therefore we only scald milk for the secondary reasons. Scalded milk is milk heated to a near boil, then cooled. It makes cakes, breads and anything with yeast fluffier and and lighter.  Scalding milk kills the protein, allowing the gluten to stay intact.</p>

<p>Warm milk has a wonderful way of latching onto different flavors. Heat the milk and add an aromatic like a vanilla bean, coffee beans, fresh herbs, or a cinnamon stick, and that flavor will infuse right into the milk. This is quite helpful when you’re making something with a milk base, like ice cream or pastry cream.</p>

<p>Milk actually needs to be scalded for baking because it contains glutathione, a tripeptideÂ that softens dough, and scalding the milk destroys it.  If a recipe calls for scalded milk, the milk should be cooled down to room temperature before using it unless otherwise stated.</p>
