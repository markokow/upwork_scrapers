https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-use-baking-powder-and-baking-soda-in-a-recipe/,Question: Why Use Baking Powder And Baking Soda In A Recipe - Montalvospirits,"<p>Basically, the reason for both is because sometimes you need more leavening than you have acid available in the recipe. It’s all about balance. Another reason to use both baking powder and baking soda is because they affect both browning and flavor.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_you_use_baking_soda_and_baking_powder_together""></span>Why do you use baking soda and baking powder together?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When a recipe contains baking powder and baking soda, the baking powder does most of the leavening. The baking soda is added to neutralize the acids in the recipe plus to add tenderness and some leavening.  One of the acid salts reacts with the baking soda and produces carbon dioxide gas.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_both_baking_soda_and_baking_powder""></span>Can I use both baking soda and baking powder?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>You could use baking powder alone, but then your finished baked treat might taste too acidic. Geiger says that you might also use both soda and powder when you want the recipe to taste a little tangy or develop a nice browned color.</p>

<p>If you swap in an equal amount of baking soda for baking powder in your baked goods, they won’t have any lift to them, and your pancakes will be flatter than, well, pancakes. You can, however, make a baking powder substitute by using baking soda.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_baking_soda_or_baking_powder_make_things_rise""></span>Does baking soda or baking powder make things rise?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Both baking soda and baking powder are leavening agents, which means they are added to baked goods before cooking to produce carbon dioxide and cause them to rise.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_both_baking_soda_and_baking_powder_in_banana_bread""></span>Can I use both baking soda and baking powder in banana bread?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>As a general rule, you can use either baking soda OR baking powder in banana bread – both ingredients will make your banana bread rise. While baking soda will react with acidic ingredients in the batter to raise your bread, baking powder can leaven banana bread without the addition of acidic ingredients.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_put_baking_soda_and_baking_powder_in_cookies""></span>Can you put baking soda and baking powder in cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Baking soda is generally about three times stronger than baking powder, so adjust your recipe accordingly. Baking soda and baking powder can produce cookies with different textures. Baking soda is typically used for chewy cookies, while baking powder is generally used for light and airy cookies.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_you_use_a_hot_oven_when_baking_muffins""></span>Why do you use a hot oven when baking muffins?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Most muffins are baked at high temperatures to help make them nice and tall.  It’s common to see muffin recipes require 375° or 400°F. That allows them to rise more testly to give them height.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_brown_sugar_activate_baking_soda""></span>Does brown sugar activate baking soda?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Baking soda is made from one ingredient – sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is a base (alkaline) that’s activated when it comes in contact with an acid, such as buttermilk, yogurt, brown sugar or vinegar (usually the acid is part of your recipe).</p>

<p>If you have a baking recipe that calls for baking soda, and you only have baking powder, you may be able to substitute, but you will need 2 or 3 times as much baking powder for the same amount of baking soda to get the same amount of leavening power, and you may end up with something that’s a little bitter tasting,.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Will_a_cake_rise_without_baking_powder""></span>Will a cake rise without baking powder?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Now, it’s important to note that cakes don’t necessarily need baking powder in order for them to rise. This is especially true if the cake is dense. There are other ways that you can make the cake rise without baking powder too. For instance, you can cream the butter and the sugar, as this will help the cake to raise.</p>

<p>If baking soda is added instead of baking powder, try the addition of an acid to the mixture. Lemon juice, orange juice, passion fruit juice are all acidic. Also is yogurt from milk. Add something citrus like lemon juice.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_brownies_need_baking_soda_or_baking_powder""></span>Do brownies need baking soda or baking powder?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Sweet and fudge-like, brownies are a classic bake sale treat or dressed-up dessert. While cookies and cakes typically rely on baking powder as leavening, brownies require less leavening and can be made with baking soda in place of baking powder.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_I_use_baking_soda_or_baking_powder_in_muffins""></span>Should I use baking soda or baking powder in muffins?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Baking soda is most commonly used in cookie and muffin recipes. Baking powder, however, already contains an acid and a base and has a more neutral taste, which works great when baking cakes and bread.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_I_use_baking_soda_or_baking_powder_in_chocolate_chip_cookies""></span>Should I use baking soda or baking powder in chocolate chip cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>1. Unless you want cakey cookies, avoid using baking powder: The cookies made with both the single- and double-acting baking powders were just too darn cakey. 2. Baking soda helps cookies spread more than baking powder.</p>

<p>What happens if you don’t put baking soda in banana bread? Baking soda is a leavening agent that causes the dough to double in size and gives it a soft and fluffy texture. When you omit it from your banana bread recipe, you end up with dense bread.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_does_my_banana_bread_taste_like_baking_soda""></span>Why does my banana bread taste like baking soda?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If the proportion of ingredients is incorrect, then the baking soda will leave a noticeable bitter taste in the bread.  Too much baking soda will also cause the banana bread to sink. Plus, baking soda is actually an alkaline ingredient and requires some form of acid to activate it.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_purpose_of_baking_soda_in_banana_bread""></span>What is the purpose of baking soda in banana bread?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Baking soda works best in conjunction with an acidic ingredient. In the case of banana bread, this may be buttermilk, brown sugar, molasses or the bananas themselves. Recipes generally include just enough baking soda to balance the acidity in the batter.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-scald-milk-in-recipes/,Quick Answer: Why Scald Milk In Recipes - Montalvospirits,"<p>Today, most milk is pasteurized, so the bacteria and enzyme are already gone. Also, scalding milk raises the temperature, which helps dissolve yeast and melt butter when added to bread recipes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_regular_milk_instead_of_scalded_milk""></span>Can I use regular milk instead of scalded milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>There is no substitute for scalded milk. You can simply use regular milk (not scalded) in your recipe. However, the milk should at least be at room temperature to not inhibit the yeast from activating properly.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_scalding_milk_necessary""></span>Is scalding milk necessary?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Scalding the milk denatures whey proteins. This makes the milk a better food for yeast, which means faster proofing, larger volume, and a fluffier product. It also makes for a smoother dough with better moisture retention. So the next time a recipe asks you to scald milk, just do it.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_does_scalding_milk_do_in_a_recipe""></span>What does scalding milk do in a recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Some baking recipes call for scalded milk; that is, milk brought nearly to a boil and then cooled down. Scalded milk makes yeast breads lighter and sponge cakes springier. It also helps dissolve sugar and melt butter, and extracts the most flavor from vanilla beans, cinnamon, citrus peels, and other flavor agents.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_dont_scald_milk""></span>What happens if you don’t scald milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The whey protein in milk can weaken gluten and prevent the dough from rising properly. Scalding the milk deactivates the protein so this doesn’t happen.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_can_you_use_in_place_of_scalded_milk""></span>What can you use in place of scalded milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Warm milk has a wonderful way of latching onto different flavors. Heat the milk and add an aromatic like a vanilla bean, coffee beans, fresh herbs, or a cinnamon stick, and that flavor will infuse right into the milk. This is quite helpful when you’re making something with a milk base, like ice cream or pastry cream.</p>

<p>Instructions  In a small saucepan over medium heat, add milk and heat until a skin forms on top of the milk, about 170 degrees. Watch carefully to make sure the milk doesn’t boil. Remove immediately from heat and cool to 110 degrees before proceeding with your recipe. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_evaporated_milk_the_same_as_scalded_milk""></span>Is evaporated milk the same as scalded milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Scalded is milk is like the beginning stages of evaporated milk, but it lets about 50% of the water evaporate to a think consistency. Sweetened condensed milk is evaporated milk, but with added sugar so it is thick, sticky and sweet.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_scalded_milk_taste_different""></span>Does scalded milk taste different?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It’s noteworthy that one can still have a nice looking, pourable microfoam, at around 155F, whereas the taste has already gone dry. But it does not say what temperature. And the taste should be as sweet. Just it should taste a bit like garlic, which is an unpleasant flavor.</p>

<p>When scalded milk is used in a yeast dough, you should assure it cools down properly. Yeast is a living micro organism and can be killed by heat. Adding yeast to hot milk will kill the yeast and as a result the bread won’t rise at all.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_does_scalding_mean_in_English""></span>What does scalding mean in English?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>1 : to burn with or as if with hot liquid or steam. 2a : to subject to the action of boiling water or steam. b : to bring to a temperature just below the boiling point scald milk. 3 : scorch. intransitive verb.</p>

<p>Milk actually needs to be scalded for baking because it contains glutathione, a tripeptideÂ that softens dough, and scalding the milk destroys it.  If a recipe calls for scalded milk, the milk should be cooled down to room temperature before using it unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>When making a custard (which serves as the base for this ice cream recipe), it is necessary to scald the milk. This accomplishes two things: it dissolves the sugar, and when whisked into eggs it increases their temperature slowly and helps prevent curdling.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_do_you_scald_milk_for_chowder""></span>Why do you scald milk for chowder?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_it_OK_to_cook_with_raw_milk""></span>Is it OK to cook with raw milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Raw milk is milk from any animal that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. Raw milk can carry harmful bacteria and other germs that can make you very sick or kill you. While it is possible to get foodborne illnesses from many different foods, raw milk is one of the riskiest of all.</p>

<p>Using a thermometer test the temperature in the middle of the milk (not touching the saucepan please). The milk is ready when it reaches 180°F (82 °C). Remove from heat and allow the scalded milk to cool to the temperature you need and use. Scalding should take about 4- 5 minutes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_the_dough_fermented_and_proofed""></span>Why is the dough fermented and proofed?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Proofing is a step in bread- and viennoiserie-baking that activates the yeast in the dough. During fermentation, the yeast cells in leavened doughs (such as bread dough or pasta dough) consume carbohydrates and expel the carbon dioxide gas that causes the dough to expand, or rise.</p>

<p>As nouns the difference between scalding and boiling is that scalding is an instance of scalding; a burn while boiling is the process of changing the state of a substance from liquid to gas by heating it to its boiling point.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-unsalted-butter-in-cookie-recipes/,Why Unsalted Butter In Cookie Recipes - Montalvospirits,"<p>Here’s why: Most importantly: unsalted butter ensures that you can control the amount of salt you add to your cakes, cookies and Fig and Almond Breakfast Cake. Different companies add different amounts of salt to their butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted_in_baking""></span>What happens if you use salted butter instead of unsalted in baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It would take quite a lot of salted butter to really produce a huge taste difference in baked goods, but it’s still good to be able to fully control the amount of salt. 2. Unsalted butter is fresher. Salt is a preservative and therefore, salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_use_unsalted_butter_in_baking_cookies""></span>Why use unsalted butter in baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Unsalted butter gives you complete control of the overall flavor of your recipe. This is especially important in certain baked goods where the pure, sweet cream flavor of butter is key (butter cookies or pound cakes). As it pertains to cooking, unsalted butter lets the real, natural flavor of your foods come through.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_use_salted_butter_for_baking_cookies""></span>Can you use salted butter for baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Technically, yes. You can use salted butter instead of unsalted butter if that’s all you’ve got, especially if you’re making something simple like cookies where the chemistry of adding salt in a specific amount and at a certain time won’t terribly affect the outcome, unlike bread.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_you_use_salted_or_unsalted_butter_for_cookies""></span>Should you use salted or unsalted butter for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Bakers and chefs usually choose unsalted butter in their recipes because it’s easier to manage the salt content in the dish. Most recipes that call for butter—especially baked goods and desserts—are created with unsalted butter. It is the standard in baking and is always implied unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_if_I_dont_have_unsalted_butter""></span>What if I don’t have unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>This substitution is extremely simple: Replace the unsalted butter called for in your recipe with an equal amount of salted butter. Then, adjust the amount of salt in the recipe to account for the extra salt in the butter.  Just give your recipe a test taste, and make any necessary adjustments.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_use_unsalted_butter_then_add_salt""></span>Why use unsalted butter then add salt?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>First, salt is used as a preservative, so salted butter sometimes doesn’t taste as fresh.  It’s easier to use unsalted butter and add the amount of salt called for in the recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_butter_is_best_for_cookies""></span>What butter is best for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>unsalted butter is generally preferred by bakers. By doing this, they can control the amount of salt in their baked goods. Butter that is unsalted is typically more fresh as well, since salt is a preservative and butter that is salted has a longer shelf life.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_substitute_unsalted_butter_for_salted_butter""></span>Can I substitute unsalted butter for salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Just remember, for every half cup (1 stick or ¼ lb) of salted butter required, you can add ¼ teaspoon of salt to Challenge Unsalted Butter.  But if you only have unsalted butter when the recipe calls for regular butter, you can add a ¼ teaspoon of salt for every stick or ½ cup of Challenge Unsalted Butter required.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_margarine_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>Can I use margarine instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>You can use margarine as a substitute for unsalted butter. Use exactly the same amount of margarine as you would butter, just be careful as margarine is more watery than butter so you might need to reduce the amount of liquid added to your recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_are_my_cookies_flat""></span>Why are my cookies flat?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If your ratios of flour, butter and sugar off, the cookie might spread too testly.  Sugar sucks up liquid, and when those cookies bake, it’ll release the liquid and cause the cookies to spread out. If you use too much butter, the cookies will end up flat and greasy.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_do_you_remove_salt_from_salted_butter""></span>How do you remove salt from salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>From a chemistry perspective (not disagreeing with Leta).  Add some water to the butter, say about an equal amount. Heat it up the butter + water until the butter melts. Mix it thoroughly. Let the mixture sit until the water and butter separate. Cool and remove the butter from the top. </p>

<p>And yes, you can use salted butter for cookies, but it’s best to decrease or leave out the amount of extra salt the recipe calls for.</p>

<p>Olive oil. In most recipes, olive oil can be substituted for butter at a 3:4 ratio by volume. For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup (225 grams) of butter, you can replace it with 3/4 cups (180 ml) of olive oil.</p>

<p>Can you use Clover for baking? I always use spread or margarine in baking and often get asked why I don’t use butter.  Clover also has a lovely buttery taste that we all enjoy and so it makes complete sense to use Clover in baking and cooking too. We don’t have to buy anything extra and always have it to hand.</p>

<p>Is Salted Butter Better Than Unsalted? Now, if you’re wondering if one butter is better than the other, the answer is no. Both salted and unsalted versions are useful in cooking and baking. They are both equally delicious and make for rich, delectable recipes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_butter_do_chefs_use""></span>What butter do chefs use?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It has a higher butterfat content than American butter—82% vs 80%. The amount of difference sounds small but it is believed to be enough to account for the difference in flavor and texture. More fat, more flavor. That’s why so many chefs rely on European butter to bring out the best in their dishes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_the_brand_of_butter_make_a_difference_in_baking""></span>Does the brand of butter make a difference in baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>In baking, the flavor differences mostly disappear. High-fat butters can be used in traditional recipes. “You shouldn’t see much difference,” said Kim Anderson, director of the Pillsbury test kitchen, “maybe a slightly richer flavor and more tender crumb.” Most important is that butter be well preserved.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_purpose_of_butter_in_cookies""></span>What is the purpose of butter in cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The job of butter in baking (besides being delicious) is to give richness, tenderness and structure to cookies, cakes, pies and pastries. We alter the way butter works in a recipe by changing its temperature and choosing when to combine it with the other ingredients.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_does_melted_butter_affect_cookies""></span>How does melted butter affect cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Adding melted butter to your recipe will change your cookies’ and cakes’ structure, density, and texture: Adding melted butter instead of the traditional softened butter will result in a chewier cookie. Softened butter in cookie dough will give you a more cake-like cookie.</p>

Most often, it’s used to add cheesy flavor to plant-based recipes, like my Vegan Mac and Cheese. There, it creates the umami that Parmesan or cheddar cheese would add to regular mac.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_nutritional_yeast_necessary_in_recipes""></span>Is nutritional yeast necessary in recipes?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Nutritional yeast is a super useful seasoning for vegan or dairy-free diets: It’s fantastic sprinkled on popcorn or nachos, or over roasted vegetables or salads.  But it’s good in non-vegan dishes too—as a flavoring in breadcrumbs for crispy chicken or fish, for instance.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_point_of_nutritional_yeast""></span>What is the point of nutritional yeast?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Nutritional yeast is a highly nutritious vegan food product with various potential health benefits. It can be used to add extra protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to meals. Studies suggest that nutritional yeast may help protect against oxidative damage, lower cholesterol and boost immunity.</p>

<p>A: Nutritional yeast has a unique savory flavor that resembles cheese, making it a great alternative for adding flavor without salt, sugar or fat. Some people say it adds a nutty flavor to foods. It can add more texture to cold dishes like salads and yet turns creamier when added to hot dishes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_I_refrigerate_nutritional_yeast""></span>Should I refrigerate nutritional yeast?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Store nutritional yeast in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator and it should keep for about two years.</p>

<p>To replace nutritional yeast, start with about ½ or ⅓ of what the recipe calls for and increase to taste. Consider also adjusting the liquids in the dish if nutritional yeast is a large portion of the recipe.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_does_nutritional_yeast_taste_like_cheese""></span>Why does nutritional yeast taste like cheese?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>As its cells die, the proteins that made up its cells break down and amino acids like glutamic acid, which is naturally found in many fruits and vegetables, are released. It’s this glutamate that gives nutritional yeast its cheese-like umami flavor. (Nutritional yeast has no added monosodium glutamate or salt.).</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_there_MSG_in_nutritional_yeast""></span>Is there MSG in nutritional yeast?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>There’s a reason nutritional yeast is so often compared to cheese: It contains naturally occurring MSG. “Monosodium glutamate is just the sodium version of glutamic acid,” said Christine Clark, a cheese writer and educator based in Burlington, Vt.</p>

<p>Nutritional yeast and active dry yeast are not interchangeable ingredients.  Nutritional yeast is a deactivated yeast that is used, especially by vegans, to thicken sauces and mimic the flavor of Parmesan cheese. Active, dry yeast is an activated yeast usually included in breads to make them rise.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_nutritional_yeast_for_baking""></span>Can I use nutritional yeast for baking?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When baking bread, you cannot use nutritional yeast as a substitute for active dry yeast, but you can use nutritional yeast flakes—which are a good source of protein, fiber, amino acids, and vitamins—to add flavor to your loaf.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Who_should_not_take_nutritional_yeast""></span>Who should not take nutritional yeast?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>People with a sensitivity to yeast products should not consume nutritional yeast. Nutritional yeast may also worsen symptoms in people with inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease. Nutritional yeast is an excellent source of fiber. A two tablespoon serving contains about 20% of your daily intake.</p>

<p>Since nutritional yeast typically isn’t eaten in very large quantities, it isn’t likely to cause weight gain. If you’ve added it to your diet and have gained weight, it is more likely that some other food you’re eating is causing the weight gain.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_nutritional_yeast_good_in_soup""></span>Is nutritional yeast good in soup?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-use-unsalted-butter-in-cookie-recipes/,Why Use Unsalted Butter In Cookie Recipes - Montalvospirits,"<p>Unsalted butter gives you complete control of the overall flavor of your recipe. This is especially important in certain baked goods where the pure, sweet cream flavor of butter is key (butter cookies or pound cakes). As it pertains to cooking, unsalted butter lets the real, natural flavor of your foods come through.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted""></span>What happens if you use salted butter instead of unsalted?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It would take quite a lot of salted butter to really produce a huge taste difference in baked goods, but it’s still good to be able to fully control the amount of salt. 2. Unsalted butter is fresher. Salt is a preservative and therefore, salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_I_use_salted_butter_for_cookies""></span>Should I use salted butter for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The simple answer is that yes, it is fine to use salted butter in baking. That being said, there is a reason that bakers – myself included – and just about all other cooks use unsalted butter as their kitchen staple instead of salted. Salt serves two roles in butter, acting as a preservative and as a flavoring agent.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Which_butter_is_best_for_baking_cookies""></span>Which butter is best for baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>unsalted butter is generally preferred by bakers. By doing this, they can control the amount of salt in their baked goods. Butter that is unsalted is typically more fresh as well, since salt is a preservative and butter that is salted has a longer shelf life.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""How_do_you_remove_salt_from_salted_butter""></span>How do you remove salt from salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>From a chemistry perspective (not disagreeing with Leta).  Add some water to the butter, say about an equal amount. Heat it up the butter + water until the butter melts. Mix it thoroughly. Let the mixture sit until the water and butter separate. Cool and remove the butter from the top. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_substitute_salted_butter_for_unsalted_butter_in_cookies""></span>Can you substitute salted butter for unsalted butter in cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Both salted butter and unsalted butter can be used interchangeably in any recipe, but if the recipe calls specifically for unsalted butter, it’s probably because the recipe has been tested with it and it’s the preferred butter for that particular recipe.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_if_I_dont_have_unsalted_butter_for_cookies""></span>What if I don’t have unsalted butter for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>This substitution is extremely simple: Replace the unsalted butter called for in your recipe with an equal amount of salted butter. Then, adjust the amount of salt in the recipe to account for the extra salt in the butter.  Just give your recipe a test taste, and make any necessary adjustments.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_are_my_cookies_flat""></span>Why are my cookies flat?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If your ratios of flour, butter and sugar off, the cookie might spread too testly.  Sugar sucks up liquid, and when those cookies bake, it’ll release the liquid and cause the cookies to spread out. If you use too much butter, the cookies will end up flat and greasy.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_brown_butter_better_for_cookies""></span>Why is brown butter better for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Browning the butter gives the cookies a more intensely nutty, butterscotch flavor. Chopping the chocolate by hand creates large and small pieces for more textural and flavor contrast.</p>

<p>Whether you’re making a creamy sauce, flaky breakfast pastries or just topping warm, fresh-baked bread, Land O Lakes® Extra Creamy Butter adds that special touch when it matters.

<p>As you might have guessed, salted contains salt while unsalted does not. According to Chef Eddy Van Damme, controlling the amount of salt in a recipe is extremely important to the outcome, so bakers and pastry chefs do not use salted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_butter_do_chefs_use""></span>What butter do chefs use?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It has a higher butterfat content than American butter—82% vs 80%. The amount of difference sounds small but it is believed to be enough to account for the difference in flavor and texture.

<p>Margarine is possibly the most-used butter substitute for baking cookies, cakes, doughnuts or just about anything else for that matter. Margarine can be used in the equal amount of butter a recipe calls for.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_substitute_unsalted_butter_for_regular_butter""></span>Can you substitute unsalted butter for regular butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>However, sometimes a recipe calls for salted butter, but all you have is unsalted butter.  But if you only have unsalted butter when the recipe calls for regular butter, you can add a ¼ teaspoon of salt for every stick or ½ cup of Challenge Unsalted Butter required.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_clover_instead_of_unsalted_butter""></span>Can I use clover instead of unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Can you use Clover for baking? I always use spread or margarine in baking and often get asked why I don’t use butter.

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_a_good_substitute_for_unsalted_butter""></span>What is a good substitute for unsalted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Substitutes for Unsalted Butter For 1 cup unsalted butter, substitute 1 cup shortening, ⅞ cup (that’s 14 Tbsp. or ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp.) vegetable oil, or ⅞ cup lard.</p>

<p>Solutions:  That fluffy texture you want in a cake results from beating a lot of air into the room temperature butter and sugar, and it does the same for cookies. Use melted butter for a denser, chewier cookie. Play with the liquid ratio in your recipe. Use all-purpose or bread flour. Increase the sugar content slightly. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_makes_a_chewy_cookie""></span>What makes a chewy cookie?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>What’s in a Chewy Cookie? Well, the long and short answer to chewy cookies is it’s all about the moisture content. Cookies that are dense and chewy incorporate more moisture into the batter. This can be achieved by making substitutions with ingredients, or even just changing the way you incorporate certain ingredients.</p>

<p>But when you’re baking, butter triumphs over margarine every time. For cakes, cookies, and pastries, butter (unsalted, that is) provides richer flavor.  Margarine, which can contain more water and less fat, may make thin cookies that spread out while baking (and may burn). Butter is also the better choice for frying.</p>

Unsalted butter is fresher. Salt is a preservative and therefore, salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_salted_butter_instead_of_unsalted_butter_for_cookies""></span>Can I use salted butter instead of unsalted butter for cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Technically, yes. You can use salted butter instead of unsalted butter if that’s all you’ve got, especially if you’re making something simple like cookies where the chemistry of adding salt in a specific amount and at a certain time won’t terribly affect the outcome, unlike bread.</p>

<p>Since unsalted butter is just churned cream with nothing else added, the flavor of the sweet cream stands out. Salted butter has a saltier taste, which can cloud the taste of your baked goods. When you want to have complete control over the flavor in your recipe, you want to use unsalted butter.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Should_I_omit_salt_if_using_salted_butter""></span>Should I omit salt if using salted butter?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>If you do need to use salted butter in a baking recipe, omit half or all of the salt the recipe calls for. This can never be a perfect substitution since the amount of salt can vary so widely.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_unsalted_butter_better_for_baking_cookies""></span>Is unsalted butter better for baking cookies?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Unsalted butter gives you complete control of the overall flavor of your recipe. This is especially important in certain baked goods where the pure, sweet cream flavor of butter is key (butter cookies or pound cakes). As it pertains to cooking, unsalted butter lets the real, natural flavor of your foods come through.</p>

<p>There are several ingredients that you can use as substitutes for unsalted butter. Salted butter, margarine, vegetable shortening, and lard are the most common and effective. They all add texture and richness to baked goods, and their taste can easily be adjusted.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_salted_or_unsalted_butter_better""></span>Is salted or unsalted butter better?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>In addition to giving a saltier taste, the salt actually acts as a preservative and prolongs the shelf life of the butter. Salted butter is perfect for spreading over crusty bread or melting over homemade pancakes or waffles. Unsalted butter contains no added salt.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_unsalted_butter_burn""></span>Does unsalted butter burn?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The first one is that salted butter will burn or scorch more easily than unsalted butter. Also, unsalted butter should always be used in a baking or dessert item because salt can “toughen” some products, creating an undesirable texture.</p>

<p>The difference between the two kinds of butter is obviously salt. Unsalted butter is all cream, while the salted variety has some salt added, though the amount varies from brand to brand.</p>

<p>Find out what the Test Kitchen has to say. There is about the equivalent of 1/4 teaspoon salt in 1/2 cup salted butter, so you can adjust your recipe accordingly and the flavor will be comparable.</p>

<p>Even though an Instant Pot can function as a pressure cooker, they’re different.  Once your food is done cooking, you can either release the pressure manually with the knob or wait for the steam to naturally release.

Here’s the story behind The Chew’s cancellation, and what happened after its goose was cooked.</p>

<p>The series originally premiered on September 10, 2018, as GMA Day.

<p>One very possible reason that The Chew was pushed out of the programming schedule was to make way for more time dedicated to the network’s Good Morning America format. According to Deadline, ABC was looking to keep up with NBC’s four-hour block of Today Show coverage, and expanding GMA was a cheaper way to do it.</p>

https://www.montalvospirits.com/why-scald-milk-for-recipes/,Why Scald Milk For Recipes - Montalvospirits,"<p>Older recipes said to scald milk to kill bacteria and an enzyme that prevented thickening in recipes. Today, most milk is pasteurized, so the bacteria and enzyme are already gone. Also, scalding milk raises the temperature, which helps dissolve yeast and melt butter when added to bread recipes.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_does_scalding_milk_do_for_a_recipe""></span>What does scalding milk do for a recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Some baking recipes call for scalded milk; that is, milk brought nearly to a boil and then cooled down. Scalded milk makes yeast breads lighter and sponge cakes springier. It also helps dissolve sugar and melt butter, and extracts the most flavor from vanilla beans, cinnamon, citrus peels, and other flavor agents.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_you_really_need_to_scald_milk""></span>Do you really need to scald milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Scalding the milk denatures whey proteins. This makes the milk a better food for yeast, which means faster proofing, larger volume, and a fluffier product. It also makes for a smoother dough with better moisture retention. So the next time a recipe asks you to scald milk, just do it.</p>
<p></p><noscript><iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""500"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkSN7bH4M-4"" width=""700""></iframe></noscript>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_dont_scald_milk""></span>What happens if you don’t scald milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>The whey protein in milk can weaken gluten and prevent the dough from rising properly. Scalding the milk deactivates the protein so this doesn’t happen.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_use_regular_milk_instead_of_scalded_milk""></span>Can I use regular milk instead of scalded milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>There is no substitute for scalded milk. You can simply use regular milk (not scalded) in your recipe. However, the milk should at least be at room temperature to not inhibit the yeast from activating properly.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Does_scalded_milk_taste_different""></span>Does scalded milk taste different?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>It’s noteworthy that one can still have a nice looking, pourable microfoam, at around 155F, whereas the taste has already gone dry. But it does not say what temperature. And the taste should be as sweet. Just it should taste a bit like garlic, which is an unpleasant flavor.</p>

<p>When scalded milk is used in a yeast dough, you should assure it cools down properly. Yeast is a living micro organism and can be killed by heat. Adding yeast to hot milk will kill the yeast and as a result the bread won’t rise at all.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_best_way_to_scald_milk""></span>What is the best way to scald milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Instructions  In a small saucepan over medium heat, add milk and heat until a skin forms on top of the milk, about 170 degrees. Watch carefully to make sure the milk doesn’t boil. Remove immediately from heat and cool to 110 degrees before proceeding with your recipe. </p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Is_evaporated_milk_the_same_as_scalded_milk""></span>Is evaporated milk the same as scalded milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Scalded is milk is like the beginning stages of evaporated milk, but it lets about 50% of the water evaporate to a think consistency. Sweetened condensed milk is evaporated milk, but with added sugar so it is thick, sticky and sweet.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Why_is_the_dough_fermented_and_proofed""></span>Why is the dough fermented and proofed?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Proofing is a step in bread- and viennoiserie-baking that activates the yeast in the dough. During fermentation, the yeast cells in leavened doughs (such as bread dough or pasta dough) consume carbohydrates and expel the carbon dioxide gas that causes the dough to expand, or rise.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Do_I_need_to_scald_milk_for_custard""></span>Do I need to scald milk for custard?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>When making a custard (which serves as the base for this ice cream recipe), it is necessary to scald the milk. This accomplishes two things: it dissolves the sugar, and when whisked into eggs it increases their temperature slowly and helps prevent curdling.</p>

<p>Scalding the milk will kill bacteria, destroy enzymes, break down the sugars, and denature many of the proteins.</p>

<p>Milk actually needs to be scalded for baking because it contains glutathione, a tripeptideÂ that softens dough, and scalding the milk destroys it.  If a recipe calls for scalded milk, the milk should be cooled down to room temperature before using it unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_is_the_difference_between_scalding_and_boiling""></span>What is the difference between scalding and boiling?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>As nouns the difference between scalding and boiling is that scalding is an instance of scalding; a burn while boiling is the process of changing the state of a substance from liquid to gas by heating it to its boiling point.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_you_drink_scalded_milk""></span>Can you drink scalded milk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Yes it is totally safe to consume burnt milk unless you are lactose intolerant or allergic to milk. Unless you are already lactose intolerant or otherwise allergic to milk. Raising milkrapidly to a temperature above the danger zone (140 F / 60 C) is going to make it safer, not less safe.</p>

<p>Using a thermometer test the temperature in the middle of the milk (not touching the saucepan please). The milk is ready when it reaches 180°F (82 °C). Remove from heat and allow the scalded milk to cool to the temperature you need and use. Scalding should take about 4- 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Buttermilk brings a pleasant tang to cakes, breads, biscuits and other family favorites while adding very little fat. Like yogurt and sour cream, this acidic ingredient also helps tenderize gluten, giving baked goods a softer texture and more body.</p>
<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""What_happens_if_you_use_milk_instead_of_buttermilk""></span>What happens if you use milk instead of buttermilk?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>In recipes that call for buttermilk, it is not recommended to replace buttermilk with plain milk, because the absence of acid will not produce the same end result. But using an acidic ingredient combined with plain milk will create a substitute with properties closer to that of buttermilk.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_skip_buttermilk_in_a_recipe""></span>Can I skip buttermilk in a recipe?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>All you need to make a substitute for buttermilk in baking recipes is milk and white vinegar, or lemon juice. I typically opt for 2% or whole milk and fresh lemon juice, but bottled will also do the trick.</p>

<p>Buttermilk brings a slightly tangy flavor to recipes and adds fluffiness (think pancakes) and a wonderful rise to baked goods. That’s because the lactic acid in buttermilk—a product of fermentation—reacts energetically with baking soda, which is usually included in leavened recipes.</p>

<p>What does marinating chicken in buttermilk do? Because of its slight acidity, buttermilk has the ability to tenderize the chicken, without it becoming tough and chewy. Using buttermilk also helps the chicken go nice and flaky when you dredge it through the dry mix.</p>

<p>Does Buttermilk Cake Need to Be Refrigerated?  Your cake can be stored at room temperature for up to five days. If you need to keep your cake longer, you can freeze it. If you want to store your frosted cake, you will want to place it in an air tight container and keep it in the fridge.</p>

<p>If you want a dairy-free version, consider soy milk or coconut milk. Half and half makes the best homemade buttermilk substitute, with whole milk as an excellent second choice. But any plain milk substitutes will work in a bind.</p>

<h2><span class=""ez-toc-section"" id=""Can_I_replace_buttermilk_with_Greek_yogurt""></span>Can I replace buttermilk with Greek yogurt?<span class=""ez-toc-section-end""></span></h2>
<p>Yogurt works best when substituted for buttermilk in a 1-to-1 ratio. That is, if a recipe calls for 1 cup of buttermilk, you can simply replace it with 1 cup of plain yogurt.  Greek yogurt, on the other hand, would not work as well because it does not have the same viscosity and may rob the recipe of moisture.</p>

<p>Buttermilk imparts a good flavor and helps the coating stick to the chicken. Its acid content tenderizes the meat.  If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, substitute plain yogurt or milk, to which a small amount of lemon juice or vinegar has been added (1 teaspoon per 1 cup milk).</p>

<p>Milk and buttermilk both make the cake moist, but the texture and taste will be a little different with each. When the recipe calls for milk, you should always use whole milk unless the recipe says otherwise. Buttermilk is especially good when used in pound cakes.</p>
