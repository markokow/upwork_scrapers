<b>[technique] Growing mushrooms on a balcony</b>

technique

(TLDR; can I grow mushrooms on a shady corner of my balcony / in the bathroom in winter?

Hey all,

Completely new to this but my partner and I are trying to go plastic free, and mushrooms are the only veg we can't buy without packaging. We live in the city and rent, but we have a decent balcony and we like growing stuff. I've seen these mushroom kits online, but am somewhat hesitant to get one without knowing if...

a) everything will die / not grow in a shady spot on the balcony (average temp about 15C, one spot in the corner never gets sun and is very good at growing moss)

or

b) if i put the kit in my bathroom or hallway, the spores are going to be a problem and we're going to get mushrooms where we don't want them? Or is it going to be a health problem?

thanks for any help y'all can give me and sorry if i'm posting in the wrong spot.

Edited: typo

Hi. 15C in the shade should be fine for most gourmet mushrooms. The only variable you'll need to control is the humidity level. If it's growing moss, it's probably not too bad, but you may have to spray the kit with water a few times a day.

Indoors, oyster mushrooms (the most common kind in kits) don't always form well. They're very sensitive to CO2 levels, which tend to build up in the winter with the windows closed. As for spores, as long as you harvest the mushrooms before they start dropping spores you should be fine. They're best to eat before that point anyway. Some people are very sensitive/allergic to mushrooms spores, but most people are fine. The only time it's usually a health risk is if you're growing commercial quantities of mushrooms and spending time around them all day.

Hi there,

I'm also mindful of reducing single use plastic in this hobby. You can find glass or re-usable plastic alternatives to most disposable plastics, or just select methods that avoid their use. You can also purchase spores and make your own spawn (as spawn generally comes in disposable bags).

Great work trying to reduce your environmental footprint!

Unfortunately, there are a lot of plastic disposables involved in mushroom cultivation due to the need for sterility.

If you don't mind purchasing spawn in a plastic bag, you can grow oysters on straw in a laundry basket or in a wire cage in that spot on your balcony. I mentioned oysters because there are cold-fruiting varieties of that particular fungus that should tolerate those 15°C temperatures. A large bag of spawn should take you through the warm season if you keep adding straw to the top of your basket and mixing it a little; you could probably split a large bag of spawn, using the first half of it to perform the initial inoculation, and sprinkling in the second half every time you add more straw.

Depending on how cold it gets there, the oysters might be able to survive the winter if you cover them in some type of insulating blanket or tarp, but the output is likely to decrease if the organism weathers into the following warm season. With that in mind, it's a smart choice to start over with another plastic bag of spawn each spring.

If you decide to get into the weeds of this hobby and take on every aspect of the front end tissue-culturing steps (all the methods needed to maintain a fungal cell line and make your own spawn) , you can limit your plastics by using glass Petries/slant tubes for storing/maintaining the tissue and glass jars for making grain spawn. If you want to learn more about what's involved in that, check out Marc Keith's video series.

Usually when we grow indoors we build some type of fruiting chamber, either from a plastic tote or one of those porch-sized greenhouses with the shelves in them, all the way up to huge grow tents or entire grow rooms. That usually involves making sawdust blocks, which are prepared and inoculated in plastic bags with a special filter attached. This can be done on a smaller scale with glass jars, but you won't get nearly the same output; that would be more of a nutritional supplement rather than a regular main course

If you do decide to grow something like oysters indoors, as long as you pick them before they drop their spores you'll be all set. It usually takes a few grows before someone is able to identify what that looks like. It's usually only the dudes who are growing a lot of mushrooms who develop allergies to them.

Wow, thanks - you answered pretty much every question I had there

I think I'm going to hold off and find out more - I'll check out that video series. A complex set up is going to be too much but I'll have a look through what's suggested and do some more research

Thank you for being so helpful!!!

Buckets are also a good option instead of bags. They're plastic, but they're re-usable.

	We've featured a number of stories about the emerging 'grow your own' scene taking place across the world on FDL. From the rooftop gardens of New York to small wine and beer brewing kits found in many homes. But the latest grow your own kit to catch our eye is Mushrooms.

Back to the Roots is a social enterprise that offers mushroom growing kits for the home. The kits are well packaged and offer fungi lovers the chance to create their own gourmet mushrooms without the need for any botanical expertise.  But what's really interesting and unique about this product is that, rather than using the traditional spores to initiate mushroom growth, these kits use waste coffee beans.

	Developed by two Berkeley students, Alex Velez and Nikhil Arora, the kits come in a number of styles and we're told to expect some new products from the pair in 2012.

	Here is a video of the pair explaining their project:
