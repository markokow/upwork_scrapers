39,What happens in the Krebs cycle of aerobic respiration?,"The Krebs cycle is an eightstep cycle in which acetyl CoA is added to oxaloacetate, which is further broken down producing CO2, reduced coenzymes (NADH + H+ and FADH2), and ATP.  During this step coenzyme A is added, <b>carbon dioxide is lost, and NAD+ is reduced, forming NADH + H+.</b>",Where does the Krebs cycle aerobic or anaerobic?,"The citric acid cycle (Kreb's cycle) is <b>anaerobic, in that it doesn't require molecular oxygen itself.

227,Can Baroreceptors override osmoreceptors?,Baroreceptors are <b>less sensitive (but more potent) than the osmoreceptors. The threshold of the volume receptors for causing changes in ADH secretion is an 8 to 10% change in blood volume. But when stimulated they cause ADH levels to be much higher than that seem with osmoreceptor stimulation.</b>,What do osmoreceptors do?,"Osmoreceptors (Fig. 4-11) located in the hypothalamus (and also in the carotid artery) are <b>capable of sensing the concentrations of solutes, particularly sodium ion. This leads to a secretion of vasopressin.</b>",What happens when osmoreceptors are activated?,"When plasma osmolality increases, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus <b>stimulate the release of ADH in blood, thus increasing water reabsorption and equilibrating plasma osmolality.</b>",How do osmoreceptors stimulate ADH?,"Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus regulate the amount of ADH released <b>in response to changes in the osmotic pressure of plasma.  This stimulates the osmoreceptors cells to contract, which results in afferent signals being sent from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary gland to increase the release of ADH.</b>",Are osmoreceptors and Baroreceptors the same?,There are two main types of receptors involved in the control of the body water balance-osmoreceptors and baroreceptors. Osmoreceptors reside in hypothalamus and respond to changes of extracellular fluid (ECF) osmolality. Baroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that sense blood pressure in the vessel wall.,How are osmoreceptors stimulated?,"When plasma osmolality increases, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus <b>stimulate the release of ADH in blood, thus increasing water reabsorption and equilibrating plasma osmolality.</b>",What are osmoreceptors sensitive to?,Special nerve cells called osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are very sensitive to <b>changes in serum osmolality.

674,What are three differences between shield and composite volcanoes?,"<b>Composite volcanoes have a low magma supply rate, resulting in infrequent eruptions. Shield volcanoes feature basaltic lava. This type of lava is hot, fluid and low in gas content. Shield volcanoes are characterized by a high magma supply rate, lending itself to frequent eruptions.</b>",What do shield and composite volcanoes have in common?,"Shield volcanoes erupt quietly.  Explosive stratovolcanoes, or composite volcanoes, have <b>steep, symmetrical, conical shapes built up over time by alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders and other volcanic particles. A central vent or cluster of vents is at the summit.</b>",How are shield and composite volcanoes formed?,"Composite volcanoes are usually found at destructive plate margins. Examples of composite volcanoes include Mount Fuji (Japan), Mount St Helens (USA) and Mount Pinatubo (Philippines). Shield volcanoes are low with gently sloping sides and <b>are formed from layers of lava. Eruptions are typically non-explosive.</b>",What is the composition of a shield volcano?,"Shield volcanoes consist largely of <b>thin lava flows, with minor pyroclastic (mainly ash) layers. Their subaerial (above sea-level) slopes are mostly 4-8 degrees, having steep-walled summit calderas and also pit craters (sinkholes) that are similar to calderas in form but much smaller.</b>",What are the major differences between shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes?,"Stratovolcanoes <b>have relatively steep sides and are more cone-shaped than shield volcanoes. They are formed from viscous, sticky lava that does not flow easily. The lava therefore builds up around the vent forming a volcano with steep sides.</b>",What are the 3 types of volcanoes describe the differences between each type?,"There are three main types of volcano - <b>composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows.  A pyroclastic flow is a superheated mixture of hot steam, ash, rock and dust.</b>",What are the 3 characteristics of a composite volcano?,"<b>Composite volcanoes have the following characteristics:</b><ul><li>Acidic lava, which is very viscous (sticky).</li><li>Steep sides as the lava doesn't flow very far before it solidifies.</li><li>Alternate layers of ash and lava. For this reason, they're also known as stratovolcanoes .  </li><li>Violent eruptions.</li><li>Longer periods between eruptions.</li></ul>",How are shield and composite volcanoes similar?,"Composite cone volcanoes are cone-shaped volcanoes composed of layers of lava, ash and rock debris.

There are several elements that these different volcano types have in common are: <b>a summit crater - the mouth of the volcano, where the lava exists. a magma chamber - where the lava wells up underground.</b>",How is the composite volcanoes formed?,Composite cone volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. They form <b>when different types of eruptions deposit different materials around the sides of a volcano. Alternating eruptions of volcanic ash and lava cause layers to form. Over time these layers build up.</b>,How are volcanic shields formed?,"Shield volcanoes are formed <b>by lava flows of low viscosity - lava that flows easily. Consequently, a volcanic mountain having a broad profile is built up over time by flow after flow of relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano.</b>",What are composite volcanoes most likely to form?,Composite volcanoes are some of the most dangerous volcanoes on the planet. They tend to occur along oceanic-to-oceanic or oceanic-to-continental boundaries because of subduction zones. They tend to be made of <b>felsic to intermediate rock and the viscosity of the lava means that eruptions tend to be explosive.</b>,How is each type of volcano formed?,"When <b>magma erupts at the surface as lava, it can form different types of volcano depending on:  the amount of gas in the magma. the composition of the magma. the way in which the magma reached the surface.</b>",What composition do shield volcanoes have?,lava flows,Are shield volcanoes Composite?,"<b>Composite volcanoes are tall, steep cones that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped mounds from effusive eruptions. Cinder cones are the smallest volcanoes and result from accumulation of many small fragments of ejected material.</b>",Do shield volcanoes have mafic composition?,Composite Cones - Stratovolcanoes Intermediate lavas are more viscous than the <b>mafic lava which forms shield volcanoes (see above) and normally contain more volatiles.</b>,What is volcanic composition?,"There are three basic types of magma: basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic, each of which has a different mineral composition. All types of magma have a significant <b>percentage of silicon dioxide. Basaltic magma is high in iron, magnesium, and calcium but low in potassium and sodium.</b>",What are the main characteristic differences between Shield and Strato volcano?,"Size Differences Composite volcanoes, also known as stratovolcanoes, are towering structures, often rising more than 10,000 feet. <b>Shield volcanoes are broad, typically 20 times wider than they are high.
