For most physical applications or analysis purposes, advanced techniques of integration are required, which reduce the integrand analytically to a suitable solvable form. Two such methods – Integration by Parts, and Reduction to Partial Fractions are discussed here. Both have limited applicability, but are of immense use in solving integrands which may seem unsolvable otherwise. So let’s begin!

Integration by Parts



Another useful technique for evaluating certain integrals is integration by parts. Here, the integrand is usually a product of two simple functions (whose integration formula is known beforehand). One of the functions is called the ‘first function’ and the other, the ‘second function’. The general formula for the Integration by parts method then can be given as –∫uvdx=u∫vdx–∫[ddx(u)∫vdx]dx+cwhere both u and v are functions of x.u(x) – the first functionv(x) – the second function

The preference for deciding the first and second functions is usually as follows –Remember the code ILATE for the precedence, whereI – Inverse functionsL – Logarithmic FunctionsA – Algebraic FunctionsT – Trigonometric FunctionsE – Exponential Functions

Application – Suppose your integrand is a product of two functions – exponential and logarithmic. On comparing with the ILATE form of precedence, the logarithmic function will be chosen as the first function and the exponential function can then be taken as the second function for easy evaluation. Thus, for solving ∫(ex)log(4x2)dx, we can choose log(4x2) as the first function, and the ex as the second function to easily obtain the result.

Method of Partial Fractions

This method relies on the fact that the integration of functions of the form1f(x), where f(x) is a linear function with some exponent, can be done quite easily. Thus, the integrands involving polynomial functions in their numerator and denominator are reduced to partial fractions first, to ease the process of integration.

Different types of integrands need to be handled differently under this method. Therefore, we have the following three general cases –

Assume that the integrand is of the formP(x)Q(x)with both P(x) and Q(x) being polynomials that may be factorized into multiple polynomials. Under every case, we’ll evaluate the partial fractions only under the condition that the degree of P(x) is less than the degree of Q(x).

Case I: Q(x) contains non-repeated linear factors

Basically, Q(x) in this case should be of the form (x – a)(x – b)(x – c)… while P(x) may be any polynomial that satisfies the condition of its degree being less than that of Q(x).

Example – To find the partial fractions corresponding tox(2–x)(x+3):Letx(2–x)(x+3)=A(2–x)+B(x+3)=A(x+3)+B(2–x)(2–x)(x+3)

To find A and B, now we will equate the coefficients of the numerators on both sides of the equation, since the fraction represented by them is the same. We then get –

x = A(x + 3) + B(2 – x)

Now we can proceed by equating the coefficients of equal powers of x on both sides, which is the standard method of solving such algebraic equations; or, we may use a shortcut.

Note that on substituting x = -3 in the equation, we get –

-3 = A(-3 + 3) + B(2 – (-3))-3 = 0 + 5BB = -3/5

Similarly, on substituting x = 2;

2 = A(2 + 3) + B(2 – 2)2 = 5A + 0A = 2/5

Clearly, all we did was to subsitute the values of x that made the coefficient of A and B = 0 separately. Our final result then can be written as -x(2–x)(x+3)=A(2–x)+B(x+3)x(2–x)(x+3)=25(2–x)–53(x+3)

You can also see from the shortcut that you may directly substitute the values of x for which the denominators of our partial fractions tend to go to 0 as well. For eg – To make the denominator ofB(x+3)= 0, we substitute x = -3 throughout the equation, after multiplying the entire equation by the denominator of  B(x+3)i.e. (x + 3). We’ll then be left with –

x(2–x)(x+3).(x+3)=A(2–x).(x+3)+B(x+3).(x+3)x(2–x)=A(2–x).(x+3)+BNow put x = -3 to get –3(2–(−3))=A(2–x).(−3+3)+BB=−53, which is the same result as before.

A similar analysis can be done to find A as well. This way, all the partial fractions of an integrand of the formP(x)Q(x)can be found, where the degree of P(x) is less than that of Q(x).

Case II: Q(x) contains one or more repeated linear factors

Here, Q(x) may have repeated roots and could be of the form (x – a)(x – b)3(x – c)2…In such a case, if a linear factor is repeated n times in the denominator, there will be n corresponding partial fractions with degree 1 to n.

Example – To find the partial fractions corresponding to1(x–1)2(x+1):Let1(x–1)2(x+1)=A(x–1)+B(x–1)2+C(x+1)=A(x–1)(x+1)+B(x+1)+C(x–1)2(x–1)2(x+1)

To find A,B and C, now we will equate the coefficients of the numerators on both sides of the equation, since the fraction represented by them is the same. We then get –

1 = A(x – 1)(x + 1) + B(x + 1) + C(x – 1)2

Now we can proceed by equating the coefficients of equal powers of x on both sides or, once again we may proceed by direct substitution.

Note that on substituting x = 1 in the equation, we get –

1 = A(1 – 1)(1 + 1) + B(1 + 1) + C(1 – 1)21 = 0 + 2B + 0B = 1/2

Similarly, on substituting x = -1;

1 = A(-1 – 1)(-1 + 1) + B(-1 + 1) + C(-1 -1)21 = 0 + 0 + 4CC = 1/4

Now to get A, we may substitute the values of B and C in the numerator balance equation, along with any arbitrary value of x (besides 1 and -1) to get –

1 = A(x – 1)(x + 1) + B(x + 1) + C(x – 1)2Put B = 1/2 and C = 1/41 = A(x – 1)(x + 1) +12(x + 1) +14(x – 1)2Then let us put x = 0 in this case because it seems like an easy value to evaluate the equation for.: 1 = A(0 – 1)(0 + 1)  +12(0 + 1) +14(0 – 1)2 : 1 = -A +12+14: A = -14

Our final result then can be written as -1(x–1)2(x+1)=A(x–1)+B(x–1)2+C(x+1)=–14(x–1)+12(x–1)2+14(x+1)

Similarly, all other partial fractions in the case of a repeated linear root may be found.

Case III: Q(x) contains a higher order polynomial factor

Under this case, some factors of Q(x) might be quadratic, cubic or higher order polynomials in nature. Let us understand this method with respect to a quadratic term in the denominator –

Example – To find the partial fractions corresponding tox3–2x4–1:

First let us factorize the denominator –x4–1=(x2–1)(x2+1)=(x–1)(x+1)(x2+1).Now, letx3–2(x–1)(x+1)(x2+1)=A(x–1)+B(x+1)+Cx+D(x2+1)=A(x+1)(x2+1)+B(x–1)(x2+1)+(Cx+D)(x–1)(x+1)(x–1)(x+1)(x2+1)

Basically, we have chosen the numerator for the partial fraction involving the quadtratic term as a linear function in x: Cx + D (i.e. one degree less than the denominator).

To find A,B,C and D, now we will equate the coefficients of the numerators on both sides of the equation, since the fraction represented by them is the same. We then get –

x3 – 2 = A(x + 1)(x2 + 1) + B(x – 1)(x2 + 1) + (Cx + D)(x – 1)(x + 1)

Now we can proceed by equating the coefficients of equal powers of x on both sides; or once again proceed with direct substitution.

Note that on substituting x = 1 in the equation, we get –

13 – 2 =A(1 + 1)(12 + 1) + B(1 – 1)(12 + 1) + (C.1 + D)(1 – 1)(1 + 1)-1 = 4A + 0 + 0A = -1/4

Similarly, on substituting x = -1;

(-1)3 – 2 =A(-1 + 1)((-1)2 + 1) + B(-1 – 1)((-1)2 + 1) + (C.(-1) + D)(-1 – 1)(-1 + 1)-3 = 0 – 4B + 0B = 3/4

Now we have no option but to compare the coefficients of same powers of x on both sides.

Coefficient of x3 on LHS  = Coefficient of x3 on RHS1 = A + B + CUse values of A and B to get –C = 1/2

Constant term on LHS  = Constant term on RHS1 = A – B – DUse values of A and B to get –D = 1

Our final result then can be written as -x3–2(x–1)(x+1)(x2+1)=A(x–1)+B(x+1)+Cx+D(x2+1)=−14(x–1)+34(x+1)+x/2+1(x2+1)=−14(x–1)+34(x+1)+x+22(x2+1)

Similarly, all other partial fractions in the case of a higher polynomial function may be found.

Definite Integration

All of the integration fundamentals that you have studied so far have led up to this point, wherein now you can apply the integral evaluation techniques to more practical situations by incorporating the boundaries (or the limits) to which your integrand actually holds true.

This is that branch of integration which is of widespread use in Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, and many other disciplines. Its utilization in the task of finding the area under a curve finds great application in estimating the total revenues from related marginal functions, or the total growth from the growth rates trend graph etc. So let’s understand its working formula!

Given an integral∫f(x)dx. We call the evaluation of such an integral as Indefinite Integration.

Formula

The solution of this integration is a resultant function in x plus some arbitrary constant. Let us represent the solution in this form –

∫f(x)dx=F(x)+c

In the method of definite integration, the integral actually has to evaluated in some domain of the variable x. Therefore, we represent it by∫x2x1. What this actually means is that the integrand f(x) now will be bound over the values which the variable of integration i.e. x assumes here, which is x1 to x2. Then we can give the end result by –

∫x2x1f(x)dx=F(x2)–F(xa)Here, x2 – The Upper Limitx1 – The Lower Limit

Note that there is no arbitrary constant of integration in the solution of a definite integration. Also, you need to know beforehand the result of the indefinite integration of f(x), then use its value at the limits of integration to get this solution.

Properties

For a,b,c as real numbers –

∫baf(x)dx=∫baf(t)dt{Change of variable of integration}

⇒∫baf(x)dx=–∫abf(x)dx{Reversal of Lower and Upper Limits}

⇒ \(\int_a^b f(x)dx = \int_a^c f(x)dx + \int_c^b f(x)dx, where a<c<b

⇒∫a0f(x)dx=∫a0f(a–x)dx

⇒ If f(x) = f(a + x) {Periodic Function};∫na0f(x)dx=n∫a0f(x)dx

⇒∫a−af(x)dx=2∫a0f(x)dx if f(-x) = f(x) {Even Function}= 0 if f(-x) = -f(x) {Odd Function}

These properties are very useful for changing the limits, or simplifying the integral given in the problem. Thus, we must understand and memorize them well. Now let us look at some solved examples on what we have learned so far.

Question: Solve∫x2lnxdxSolution: We’ll use integration by parts here with x2 (algebraic) as the second function, and ln x (logarithmic) as the first function. Using the formula, we get –∫x2lnxdx=lnx∫x2dx–∫[ddx(lnx)∫x2dx]dx+c=lnx.x33–∫[1x.x33]dx+c=x3lnx3–∫x23dx+c=x3lnx3–x39+c

Question: Solve∫+2−2x2dxSolution: First, you must note that for this definite integral, the integrand x3 is an even function, that is –

The preparation of the ammonium iodide takes place by the action of hydroiodic acid on the ammonia. It is easily soluble when we mix it in the water (H2O). Moreover, by the process of mixing it with the water, it crystallizes in the shape of cubes. It is also soluble when putting inside the solution of ethanol and then, as a result, it turns yellow on standing in the moist air, owing to decomposition with the process of liberation of the iodine. Read on further to know about Ammonium Iodide Formula.

Structure and Formula

The molecular formula of the ammonium iodide is H4IN and its structure is present below in the form of an image:



Preparation

Firstly we dissolve 254 grams of the potassium iodide in 125 ml of water (H2O) and mix it with 100 grams of ammonium sulfate. Then we have to dissolve in 125 ml of boiling water. After it cools down, we add 40 ml of alcohol and then we keep the mixture for a time period of 12 hours.

However, then we obtain a precipitate of potassium sulfate that we filter and then we evaporate the filtrate occasionally by adding ammonia water that is containing some amount of alcohol until the process of crystallization starts. Then the crystals of the potassium sulfate are additionally washed with the dilute alcohol that is about 20 percent. Moreover, after combining the filtrates and evaporating finally the ammonium iodide is obtained as a result.

(NH4)2SO4+ 2KI →2NH4I + K2SO4

The ammonium iodide crystallizes in the shape of cubes and deliquesces in the air. We have to preserve it in a dark place because the light decomposes the salt, causing it to turn brown in color. We can remove this coloration by dissolving it in distilled water.

After that, then treating the solution with the ammonium sulfide, filtering, and evaporating the filtrate with the help of the steam bath, to crystallize. It is readily soluble in alcohol. The aqueous solution turns yellow in color on standing, owing to the decomposition and separation of the iodine. One part of the salt dissolves in 0.60 parts of the water (H2O).

The ammonium iodide can also be made in a laboratory. By the process of reacting ammonia or ammonium hydroxide with the hydroiodic acid or the hydrogen iodide gas:

NH3+ HI → NH4I

NH4OH + HI → NH4I + H2O

Uses

The ammonium iodide is useful in many ways and one of them is in photographic chemicals. Moreover, we also generally use it in the process of making various types of medicines.

Properties

The ammonium iodide is visible in the form of a white crystalline powder. In addition, it has a melting point of 551 °C whereas, it has a boiling point of 405 °C. Its molar mass is 144.94 g/mol with a density of 2.51 g/cm³. It is easily soluble when putting inside the water (H2O).

Safety and Health Hazards

Due to the inhalation of the ammonium iodide a person may suffer from multiple health issues, some of them are irritation of nose and throat. Contact of the ammonium iodide with the naked eyes of a living being can cause irritation in the eyes. The toxic and irritating fumes of the hydrogen iodide, iodine, and oxides of nitrogen may result in the fire. The compound may sublime into the fire and then condense on the cold surfaces. The ammonium iodide should be kept in a tightly closed and protected container and the sunlight should not enter that container.

It is a liquid that has no color and has a strong characteristic odor. In the concentrated form, ammonium hydroxide can result in burns on coming in contact with the skin. Moreover, with the ordinary household ammonia, useful as a cleanser, is dilute ammonium hydroxide. The water solution is basically represented by the formula i.e. NH4OH, though no appreciable amount of the molecular species NH4OH is present over there. The solution consists primarily of large amounts of water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3) and smaller amounts of the ammonium ion, NH4+, and the hydroxide ion, OH–. Let’s study about Ammonium Hydroxide Formula in detail.

Formula and Structure

The chemical formula of the ammonium hydroxide is NH4OH. The molar mass is 35.04 g/mol-1. The compound structure is made by 1 hydroxide anion (OH–) and 1 ammonium cation NH4+ and these share an ionic bond. An image showing its chemical structure is below in the common representations that we generally use for the organic molecules.

Source: pubchem

Occurrence

Ammonium hydroxide occurs by the dissolution of ammonia inside the water. However, this is a totally natural process.

Preparation

The ammonium hydroxide is made mostly by the direct reaction of the hydrogen and the nitrogen together, metal catalyzes it as an iron. Then we add the resulting ammonia to the water to make ammonium hydroxide.

Physical Properties

Ammonium hydroxide is a colorless liquid that has a highly pungent odor. Ammonium hydroxide has a density of 0.91 g/mL-1. The melting point is -57.5oC and it has a boiling point of 37oC. It is highly miscible with the water.

Chemical Properties

Ammonium hydroxide is a basic compound that partially dissociates in the water keeping the next equilibrium with the ammonium ion and the hydroxide ion, moreover, it is a weak compound:

NH4OH + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH−

The equilibrium comes in use for regulating the pH of the solutions due to the ion OH– maximizes the pOH of the basicity level of any solution.

Basicity of Ammonia in Water

In an aqueous solution, the ammonia deprotonates a minimal fraction of the water to provide ammonium and hydroxide:

NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH−.

In a 1M ammonia solution, about 0.42% of the ammonia changes into ammonium that is equivalent to a pH of 11.63 because [NH4+] = 0.0042 M, [OH–] = 0.0042 M, [NH3] = 0.9958 M, and pH = 14+log10[OH–] = 11.62. [citation needed] The base ionization constant is

Kb = [NH4+][OH−]/[NH3] = 1.8×10−5

Uses

Ammonium hydroxide’s most common use is as a household cleaner, for this purpose it comes in use as a solution of 1-3%. In some chemical processes, we can use it as a precursor to form the alkylamines. Moreover, we also use the Ammonium hydroxide as an acidity regulator to reduce the acidity in food due to the release of the hydroxide in the solution.

Health Effects/Safety Hazards

Ammonium hydroxide can also cause severe damage to the eyes and the skin. It is very toxic to aquatic life at the same time.

Laboratory Use

Many traditional qualitative inorganic analysis uses aqueous ammonia as a complex ant and base. Like multiple amines, it provides a deep blue color with copper (II) solutions. However, the ammonia solution can dissolve the silver oxide residues, such as those formed from Tollens’ reagent. It is also present in the solutions we generally use to clean gold, silver, and platinum jewellery also but may have adverse effects on porous gemstones such as the opals and the pearls.

It readily ignites and burns and produces a voluminous residue that has a green color. However, if we start heating it in a closed container, the container may rupture because of the decomposition of the material. It can also act as a strong oxidizing agent when mixed with or contaminated with the combustible material. It dissolves when put inside the water. Moreover, in this compound, as in all the chromates and the dichromates, chromium is in a +6 oxidation state that is commonly called hexavalent chromium. Let’s learn about Ammonium Dichromate Formula in detail.

It is a salt that comprises of the ammonium ions and dichromate ions both at the same time. The Ammonium dichromate is also popular by the name ‘vesuvian’ Fire sometimes, because of its application in the demonstrations of the tabletop ‘volcanoes’. However, this demonstration is not so popular in the schools due to the carcinogenic nature of the compound. In the early days of photography and some of the pyrotechnics use it.

Ammonium Dichromate Formula and Structure

The molecular formula of the ammonium dichromate is (NH4)2Cr2O7. And its structure id given in the image provided below.



Properties

At room temperature and pressure, the compound exists in orange color acidic crystals that are soluble in water and alcohol. Its production takes place by the action of the chromic acid on the ammonium hydroxide with subsequent crystallization. The (NH4)2Cr2O7 crystal (C2/c, z=4) consists of a single type of ammonium ion. Moreover, at the sites of symmetry C1 (2,3). Every single NH4+ center is irregularly surrounded by 8 oxygen atoms at N—O distances that range from ca. 2.83 – ca. 3.17 Å, typical of the bonds of hydrogen.

Uses

It has various applications like pyrotechnics and in the early time of photography as well as in the lithography, as a source of pure nitrogen in the chemistry labs, and also as a catalyst. In addition, industries also use it as a mordant in the process of dying in the dyeing pigments, in the manufacturing process of the alizarin, chrome alum, leather tanning and in oil purification as well.

Photosensitive films that contain PVA, ammonium dichromate and a phosphor are spin-coated as liquid slurries in the production of the phosphor raster of the TV screens and LCDs and many other different devices. On the other hand, the ammonium dichromate acts as the photoactive site as well.

Reactions

The volcano demonstration includes the igniting of a pile of the salt and this initiates the following exothermic conversion:

(NH4)2Cr2O7 (s) → Cr2O3 (s) + N2 (g) + 4 H2O (g) (ΔH = −429.1 ± 3 kcal/mol)

Like the ammonium nitrate, it is also thermodynamically unstable. Its decomposition reaction proceeds to the process of completion once we initiate it, producing voluminous powder of chromium (III) oxide that is dark green in color.

Not all of the ammonium dichromate decomposes in this specific reaction. When the dark green color powder mixes up in the water then, as a result, a yellow or an orange color solution is the outcome we get from the leftover ammonium dichromate.

Safety

The Ammonium dichromate is similar to all the chromium (VI) compounds and it is highly toxic and also a proven carcinogen. Moreover, it is also a strong irritant at the same time.

Incidents

In the airtight and sealed containers, ammonium dichromate may explode if provided excess heat. In the year 1986, 2 workers lost their lives and 14 others were injured at the Diamond Shamrock Chemicals in Ashtabula, Ohio when about 2,000 lbs. of ammonium dichromate exploded because it was being dried in a heater.

Further, to improve the adhesion between the solders. Similarly, many types of cold and cough medicines or remedies also use it because of its efficacy as an expectorant. Ammonium Chloride Formula will help you understand this better.

Ammonium chloride is a crystalline substance that has no color. Further, it is highly soluble when mixed with water. The ammonium chloride is produced as a by-product in the ammonia-soda process that is conducted for forming the sodium carbonate. On the other hand, it is also produced by the reaction of the ammonium sulfate and sodium chloride solutions. However, when the ammonium chloride is mixed with slaked lime i.e. calcium carbonate, the result that comes out is the ammonia gas.

Formula and Structure

The chemical formula of the ammonium chloride is NH4Cl and it has a molar mass of 53.490 g mol-1. Moreover, this molecule is formed by two potassium cations K1+ and 1 dichromate anion Cr2O72-.

Ammonium chloride is present in mineralogical creations and in this form we refer to it as the ‘salt ammoniac’. In addition to this, it is also present in various volcanic vents and ashes.

Preparation

One can also prepare Ammonium chloride by multiple methodologies. The first one is through the neutralization with the HCl of the ammoniacal residue made in the distillation of the coal.

NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl

The 2nd strategy is by the Solvay process to get the sodium carbonate or bicarbonate and where the ammonium chloride is present as a by-product.

Further, it is soluble in water, ethanol, methanol, and glycerol and it is also slightly soluble in the acetone. Moreover, it is insoluble in organic solvents such as ethyl acetate.

Chemical Properties

Ammonium chloride may suffer various types of reactions of great value to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries respectively. It can decompose when one heats it into hydrochloric acid and ammonia (a reaction I).

NH4Cl → NH3 + HCl (I)

NH4Cl + NaOH → NH3 + NaCl + H2O (II)

2 NH4Cl + Na2CO3 → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O + 2 NH3 (III)

Uses

Ammonium chloride has a large source of the nitrogen, so that and similarly to the urea we also use it as fertilizers and add it to the media of bacteria and yeast growth. Moreover, we also use it for the preparation of some metals before galvanization that needs a surface that is free of metal oxides. Further, the pharmaceutical industry also uses ammonium chloride to produce cough syrups and medicines.

Health Effects/Safety Hazards

Ammonium chloride is very poisonous and toxic and can cause damage to organs by ingestion. It also causes serious eye damages.

Question: Do a solution of NH4Cl and NH4OH acts as a buffer?

Solution: NH4Cl is a strong electrolyte hence, dissociates completely, NH4OH is a weak electrolyte. Its dissociation is further suppressed by common ion NH4+ provided by NH4Cl in the solution.

NH4Claq ⇌ NH4+aq + Cl–aq

NH4OHaq ⇌ NH4+aq + OH‑aq

This solution acts as a basic buffer and maintains its pH around 9.25. It is capable of resisting the change in pH on the addition of a small amount of acid or alkali.

It forms by the process of blending the carbon dioxide and aqueous ammonia together. Moreover, one commonly uses it as a leavening agent and as a smelling salt. It is so because of its property of degrading to the gaseous ammonia and the carbon dioxide when it is heated.

The Ammonium Carbonate is a white, crystalline salt that has a chemical formula i.e. (NH4)2CO3.



Production

Ammonium carbonate is made by the combination of carbon dioxide and the aqueous ammonia. However, about 80000 tons per year were produced as of 1997. The ammonium carbonate can be produced by carbon dioxide. This consists of, sending the carbon dioxide and the ammonia gas with the purity level of about 99-99.99 percent into 2 buffer gas vats with a pressure of 0.2 to 2MPa.

Opening the valve of the vats to release the flow of the gas by the Rota meter into a sealed PVC synthesis reaction bag and form the product. Wherein, the speed of the flow is (0.6-2) X 106L/h, and (0.1-0.6) X 106L/h for carbon dioxide and the ammonia gas separately.

Decomposition

The Ammonium carbonate decomposes at a very slow speed with standard temperature and pressure through 2 pathways. Thus any initially pure sample of the ammonium carbonate will soon turn into a mixture that includes various by-products. Ammonium carbonate has the capability to spontaneously decompose into the ammonium bicarbonate and the ammonia.

(NH4)2CO3 → NH4HCO3 + NH3

Which later on decompose into the carbon dioxide, water and some other molecules of ammonia.

NH4HCO3 → H2O + CO2 + NH3

Uses

Leavening Agent

The Ammonium carbonate also works as a leavening agent in some traditional recipes, particularly those from northern Europe and Scandinavia for example, Speculoos, Tunnbröd or Lebkuchen. It was the ancestor to today’s more commonly used general baking powder.

Some Other Uses

Ammonium carbonate is the main component of the smelling salts. Although, the commercial scale of their production process is smaller. Buckley’s cough syrup that is from Canada today uses ammonium carbonate as an active ingredient that helps in providing relief to the symptoms of bronchitis.

Moreover, it is also useful as an emetic. It is also present in smokeless tobacco generally chewing tobacco products like Skoal. One also uses it in the aqueous solution as a photographic lens cleaning agent that cleans the lenses, for example, Eastman Kodak’s “Kodak Lens Cleaner.”

Properties of Ammonium Carbonate

The chemical formula of Ammonium Carbonate is (NH4)2CO3. Along with this, the molecular weight is 96.09 g/mol. The density is 1.50 g/cm3. It has a melting point of 58 °C whereas, its boiling point decomposes.

Stability/Shelf Life

The ammonium carbonate decomposes on exposure to air with the loss of ammonia and the carbon dioxide, and it becomes white and powdery and starts converting into ammonium bicarbonate gradually.

Substitute

One can substitute a teaspoon of the baker’s ammonia with a teaspoon baking powder with a teaspoon of the baking soda.

Ammonium bromide (NH4Br) is the ammonium salt of hydrobromic acid. The chemical matures in prisms that are colorless, owning a salty taste. It sublimes when heated and is very easily soluble in the water. On exposure to the air, it slowly assumes a color because of the oxidation of traces of the bromide (Br−) to the bromine (Br2) and the color assumed by this is yellow. In a simple language, the ammonium bromide is the odorless crystals that are white in color or the granules which turn into yellow color when exposed with air. The ammonium bromide formula stays stable under the recommended storage conditions that have a set temperature according to the need of the ammonium bromide.

The chemical formula of the ammonium bicarbonate is NH4HCO3. The molecular formula of the ammonium bicarbonate is CH5NO3 and it has a molar mass of 79.056 g/mol. Its chemical structure comprises of the ammonium cation NH4+ and the bicarbonate anion HCO3-.

Occurrence

Ammonium bicarbonate is present in a small quantity in nitrogenous organic matter, along with multiple other ammonium salts.

Production

The Ammonium bicarbonate is made by combining two things that are carbon dioxide and the ammonia:

CO2 + NH3 + H2O → (NH4)HCO3

Since ammonium bicarbonate is unstable thermally, the reaction solution is kept under the cold temperature. Thus, this results in allowing the precipitation of the product as the white solid. About 100,000 tons were produced in a similar way in the year 1997.

Ammonia gas sent to an aqueous solution of sesquicarbonate that is a 2:1:1 mixture of (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, and H2O transforms it into a normal ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3), which can be obtained in the crystalline condition from a solution created at about 30 °C of temperature. This compound on exposure to air provides off ammonia and reverts it to the ammonium bicarbonate.

Preparation

They make Ammonium bicarbonate by the process of passing the carbon dioxide gas into aqueous ammonia until the ammonium bicarbonate crystals are complete and are then separates from the solution by the method of filtration or centrifugation. To prevent the decomposition of the product, the reaction is takes place at a cold temperature.

CO2 + NH3 + H2O → NH4HCO3

Physical Properties

Ammonium bicarbonate exists as a white crystalline solid that carries a density of 1.59 g/mL and a melting point of 41.9 °C. It has a strong aroma of ammonia, and it is highly soluble in water.

Chemical Properties

It dissolves with the water to make a mildly alkaline solution. Moreover, it is insoluble in many organic solvents.

Ammonium bicarbonate comes in use as baking powder in some food or cooking processing applications. Further, we use it in the cough syrups also and as an antacid. Further, we also use it as a fertilizer, pH buffer, and reagent in the chemical laboratories. In the industries, we use it in the manufacturing of dyes, pharmaceuticals, catalysts, ceramics, plastics, and various other products.

It is also useful for buffering solutions to make them alkaline during the chemical purification, just like the high-performance liquid chromatography. This allows recovery of the compound of interest by freeze-drying.

Health Effects/Safety Hazards

In low concentrations, it is not hazardous. Further, its common and main health hazard is its decomposition reaction providing pungent ammonia gas that is a serious irritant. Similarly, inhalation of the ammonium bicarbonate can result in irritation in the eyes, skin, nose and entire system of respiration and cause major coughing and difficulty in the process of breathing.

Solved Examples on Ammonium Bicarbonate Formula

Question: How to measure the concentration of the bicarbonate, when we are purging the solvent (water) with the normal air or CO2 gas?

Solution: We have several options depending on how accurate your result has to be.

If you know the initial pH and you’re using pure water you can obtain a good estimate by measuring the pH change combined with modelling of your system, for example with phreeqc. Alternatively, you can sample your solution, add a base to the sample and then titrate between both pK values of H2CO3. Other options are to add Ba and also make your samples alkaline. Then you can weigh the BaCO3 after drying.
